<p class='ti0'>A great many impressionable young men
who become soldiers overnight and go
to war feel strongly inspired to write books
about their adventures. I felt the same way
before the newness of the life on the western
front had been rubbed away by constant
friction with some of the more monotonous
things of war, such as hunger, cold, mud,
cooties, and other romance-destroying agents.
I buried the idea of writing a book just before
my division was called upon to stand
between the Boches and Paris during the
trying days of July and August of 1918. It
is very good for me that I detached myself
from the desire to write a war book about
that time. Experience proved that it was
necessary to give all my available time to
the business of fighting the <i>guerre</i>.</p>
<p>The book-bug never came my way again,
for I do not look upon <i>What Outfit,
Buddy?</i> as the result of answering some
insistent, invisible summons to write a war
book. I did not intend writing a war book
when I started the first line of <i>What Outfit,
Buddy?</i> I merely hoped to let Jimmy
McGee, a real, regular fighting Yank who
has seen his share of <i>la guerre</i>, tell the story
of the things that he encountered as a member
of the American Expeditionary Force.
I sincerely trust that my original intentions
have carried.</p>
<p>If I have allowed Jimmy McGee to tell you
his story, then I have fulfilled my hopes, for
I believe that Jimmy McGee’s story of the
war is merely the universal version of the
great adventure as held by legions of his
comrades.</p>
<p>In my effort to let Jimmy tell his story I
have not tried to use book language. I
have used to the best of my ability the speech
of men who became a real integral part of
the <i>guerre</i>.... To do that it was necessary
to let Jimmy and his comrades speak
French in the manner of American soldiers.
I tried to register the true value of their
struggles with the difficult French language
by resorting to phonetic spelling in the case
of practically all French words which have
become a part of the American Expeditionary
Forces’ vocabulary. Students of the beautiful,
musical language of France will, I trust,
grant me this indulgence, as I have taken the
liberties only in the desire to tell America how
its fighting men overcame the difficulties presented
by living side by side with a people
who spoke a foreign language.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER I—“WHAT OUTFIT, BUDDY?”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>Jimmy McGee, hanging on to a long, lean
loaf of brown bread with his left hand
and swinging a heavy, dangerous-looking
cane in his right grip, moved leisurely over
a white road of France toward the four-year-old
battlelines that stretched between
<i>Verdun</i> and <i>Saint-Mihiel</i>.</p>
<p>McGee, himself, was camouflaged beneath
an assortment of things and stuff that would
have made Panhandle Pete of funny-paper
fame look like a smartly dressed gentleman
in comparison. His make-up was not calculated
to allow observers much chance to
criticize his own physical attributes or failings.</p>
<p>A bit of reddish-brown hair managed to
crop up in sundry places outside the distorted
corners of the clownish thing that had been
issued him in the name of an overseas cap.
The part of his shirt collar that almost swallowed
his ears and chin came very near hiding
his freckled snub nose. But it didn’t.
The nose insisted on protruding enough to
be seen. Jimmy’s eyes, alone, were open and
ready for inspection. Any one might have
guessed the nationality of his ancestors by
the laughing blue of his eyes. What could
be seen of his features hinted that he owned
a strong, good-looking face. Perhaps his long
length of wide limb would have given him
some individuality among a gang of six-footers,
for he was exceptionally tall. Unfortunately
his height was lost in the bulk of
war-like paraphernalia that jangled from
countless straps, ropes, and belts. Otherwise
his identity was completely blanketed.</p>
<p>Nobody, except one of his own kind, would
have ever recognized him as an American
soldier. He was a sad departure from all
that Army regulations and magazine covers
had insisted upon as a typical member of the
“best dressed and best fed army” in the
world. Most likely Jimmy’s own mother
would have passed him up as a straying
peddler. Perhaps Sergeant George Neil,
McGee’s pal and bunkie, might have recognized
him by the stout, strong-muscled legs
which were swathed in muddy war-putees,—that
ended in a final strip of thin raglings
below his knees,—and moved in an easy-going
stride peculiar to his own ideas of speed.</p>
<p>However strange and disillusioning, Private,
1st Class, Jimmy McGee may have appeared
to the men who designed the uniform
and equipment of American soldiers, there
was nothing about the boy to distinguish him
apart from thousands of comrades in soiled
and torn olive-drab, who had come out of
the Chateau-Thierry rackett with their appreciation
for neatly made packs and dress-parade
tactics all shot to hell.</p>
<p>Appearances had long since ceased to count
in his young life. He had forgotten all of
the old O. D. stuff, after discovering that
“squads right” and saluting could never win
a <i>guerre</i>. Consequently Jimmy ambled along,
loaded down to the hubs under a confusion
of equipment and souvenirs that he had collected
from three fronts during the past eight
months, without a thought of anything, except
the height of the hill that he was climbing
and the emptiness of his stomach. The
fact that he didn’t know just exactly where
he was, or where his outfit might be, wasn’t
causing him any worries. He had been separated
from the battery too many times
already and this latest separation was only
twenty-four hours old,—a mere trifle to Jimmy
McGee.</p>
<p>“Lost—strayed—and stolen—Guess I’m all
three of ’em—<i>tous ensemble</i>, as the Frogs
would rattle in that darn machine gun language
of theirs,” muttered McGee as he
shifted the weight of a blanket roll that
looked as if it contained a Baby Grand piano
and a fat-legged stool.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll find the outfit before the <i>guerre
encores</i>, anyhow. If I don’t I’ll turn myself
in for salvage—anythin’ to keep from bein’
an M. P. or gettin’ in the Quartermaster
Corps. Those guys don’t——”</p>
<p>Honk!... Honk!... Honk!...</p>
<p>Jimmy shut his mouth and got himself off
of the road, just in time to miss being pressed
into an old-fashioned pancake under the
wheels of a truck that whizzed by like an
Austrian 88.</p>
<p>“Great Gods! I’d rather promenade
along the top of a trench in broad daylight
than leave my life in the hands of those fool
truck-drivers. They ain’t got a bit of respect
for a man’s body—ought to let ’em drive a
tank across No Man’s Land under a barrage
once or twice—maybe then they’d quit tryin’
to kill us poor guys that’s fightin’ this
<i>guerre</i>.”</p>
<p>McGee thought some pretty hard things
about truck drivers in general after getting
that load off his chest and started to make
another hill, being careful to hang close to
the side of the road.</p>
<p>“What outfit, Buddy?”</p>
<p>Jimmy McGee stopped still in his tracks,
steadied himself against his cane to keep from
rolling back down the steep hill, and shook
himself so roughly before answering that the
tinware, brass, steel and other whatnots
which were a part of his baggage made a
noise like the cows coming home.</p>
<p>“Twenty-Sixth Division, Jack,” he shot
back, as if he were putting over a little barrage
all by himself.</p>
<p>Then he advanced cautiously to inspect the
strange-looking person who had asked him
the old familiar question. For a passing
moment Jimmy was pretty sure that the old
gas had got to his eyes at last, or that his
thoughts were getting the best of him. Surely
the man who sat on the grass and was all
rigged up like the soldiers in the Sunday
papers and popular monthlies, must be a
model—A sort of guide or index for his kind,
thought Jimmy.</p>
<p>At last, after what seemed ten years to
the waiting, strange one, the dust-sprinkled
Yank said outloud, more to himself than anyone
else, “<i>Oui</i>—it moves and breathes—guess
it’s real—take a chance, anyhow.” Then to
the object of his remarks: “What outfit,
yourself, old man?”</p>
<p>“None—that is, so far,” was the astonishing
answer, made in a voice that hadn’t taken
on the tone of confidence which Jimmy knew
well could only be found out where he and a
bunch of his side-kickers had been living during
the past few months.</p>
<p>“Well—that’s a hell of a good outfit to
belong to. Guess you ain’t bothered with
second lieutenants much then, eh?” queried
Jimmy, pushing his shapeless roll over his
head and letting it fall to the earth with a
thud.</p>
<p>“How do you mean—worried?” asked the
wondering man, whose appearance brought
back memories of the hated O. D. days to
Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Oh, you never had many of ’em hangin’
around you for salutes, givin’ foolish commands
that ought to be listed with dead letters
in the office at Washington. That’s what
I’m gettin’ at.... Get me, now?”</p>
<p>A gas-mask, two bulging <i>musettes</i>, the bottom
of a mess-kit, and a French canteen were
thrown to the ground. McGee’s great height
began to assert itself. He stretched his long
arms and shook a case of field-glasses and a
German luger aloose from their insecure attachments
to his left shoulder straps.</p>
<p>“Yes, I see now. No, can’t say that I’ve
minded them so much as I haven’t been in
the Army long,” replied Jimmy’s roadside
find.</p>
<p>“So,” muttered Jimmy reflectively. “Say,
when in hell did you enlist anyway?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t—I was drafted,” answered O. D.,
as McGee had already mentally nicknamed
the man in front of him.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>—<i>Oui</i>—I <i>compree</i>,” said the product
of eight months in the mud and rain of the
Western Front, nodding his head affirmatively.</p>
<p>Silence for a moment and then Jimmy said
what was on his mind.</p>
<p>“Say, how does it feel to be that way buddy?
It don’t bother you at nights does it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t quite understand you,” stammered
the product of General Crowder’s machine.</p>
<p>“<i>Pas compree</i>, eh? Just like a Frenchman
when he don’t want to give you what
you want,” answered Jimmy. “Well I’ll try
to shoot away the camouflage this time.
Don’t you ever wish that you’d enlisted?”</p>
<p>“Sure—I wanted to enlist when the war
first started but my Dad had just died and
he didn’t leave much; not enough to pay his
funeral expenses. My mother has always
been sickly and Mary hadn’t finished her
business-schooling yet. I had to work like the
deuce to keep things going— Then I was
drafted.”</p>
<p>“That’s just the way with this damn
army,” interrupted Jimmy sympathetically.
“They do everything like the French, backwards.
Why the devil couldn’t they have
let you stay home and take care of your
mother and Mary? There’s enough of us big
hams without any cares to fight this war.
Who is Mary, your sister?” asked Jimmy
bluntly; but he meant to be gentle.</p>
<p>“Yes, she is my sister; only nineteen. Two
years younger than me,” explained the
drafted man.</p>
<p>“How’s Mary and your ma makin’ it
now?” was Jimmy’s next question.</p>
<p>“Mary’s finished business school and has
a good job. I make a twenty-dollar allotment,
and my mother gets twenty-five dollars
from the Government along with that.
They’re doing pretty good now, so their letters
tell me,” was the frank response.</p>
<p>Jimmy sat down next to the recruit and
started to hack off a couple of slices of bread
according to the French way of doing it. He
gave him a slice.</p>
<p>“Slap some of this <i>confiture</i> on it,” pointing
to a tin of jam. “You won’t mind if I
call you O. D., will you?”</p>
<p>“No; but what makes you want to call me
that? My right name’s William G. Preston.”</p>
<p>“Damn glad to know you, Bill,” said Jimmy,
shooting out his right hand; “but about
this O. D. stuff?”</p>
<p>“What’s that gold stripe on your sleeve
for?” gasped Bill. “Have you been over
here six months?” was the amazing question.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, but that’s a wound stripe on the
right sleeve—this is the sleeve for service
chevrons,” and McGee exhibited two greasy
and rumpled service chevrons.</p>
<p>Bill gasped a second time. “Why, you’ve
been here twelve months. You must have
come over on the first troop-ship. Where
and how were you wounded?”</p>
<p>The questions were coming too fast for
Jimmy McGee. He reached for his gas-mask
and tin hat.</p>
<p>“Hold it a minute till I get my wind—all
right. I’ve been here twelve months—I’m
sure o’ that. No, I didn’t come over on the
first troop-ship. I sailed over on the first
mule-ship—one of those twenty-three-day-at-sea-affairs.
In those days we didn’t have
separate stalls for the mules and men. Everybody
and everythin’ <i>cushayed</i> together down
in the hold—except the officers, of course.”</p>
<p>“I came over in eight days, and on a big
liner— A mule-ship—uuggh!” shuddered William
G. Preston, soon to be regenerated under
the name of O. D. “But where did you get
wounded, and how?”</p>
<p>“I got it in the calf of the leg—fragment
from high explosive that the Heinies were
rainin’ down the night we staged a battle
at Seicheprey—first fight of the <i>guerre</i> for
the Americans, you know,” asserted McGee,
solemnly. “I only got a little tear in the
muscle. Poor old Gordon, my pal, he got his
left shoulder and part of his head torn off.
He died quick, though; didn’t suffer much.
They gave his folks the D. S. C., as he did
some big hero stuff. But that ain’t gettin’
Frank much,” soliloquized the veteran of
Seicheprey, reminiscently.</p>
<p>Jimmy saw that Preston was getting too
interested and might ask for a story about the
war, so he directed traffic in another direction.</p>
<p>“You didn’t give me a chance to tell you
why I want to call you O. D. Now, you see,
we call anything that is regulation, red tape,
and all that kind of stuff, O. D.—just a sort
of nickname. When I first saw you I thought
you was a soldier out of the drill-regulation
book or a model for some magazine artist.
You see, you’re all made up accordin’ to the
blue-print. Carry your blankets just so; wear
your cap at a right slant; got your blouse
buttoned up. Hell fire! you’re O. D.-lookin’,
that’s all. You’re the first of that kind I’ve
seen in a mighty long time, so I’m going to
call you O. D.... From now on you’re
O. D.... <i>Compree?</i>”</p>
<p>“Have it your way. What’s your name?”
asked O. D.</p>
<p>“McGee. Jimmy, most of the gang calls
me. Do the same.”</p>
<p>“All right, Jimmy.”</p>
<p>“You say you’re a replacement?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I arrived in Bar-le-Duc yesterday
with a detail and got separated from it. The
A. P. M. told me to take this road and keep
on going until I located my regiment,” explained
O. D.</p>
<p>“Got lost, myself, last night,” admitted
Jimmy. “What outfit are you goin’ to?”</p>
<p>“The One Hundred and Third Field Artillery.
What division is that?” O. D.’s
question was drowned under Jimmy’s
whoop.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m a son-of-a-gun! That’s my own
outfit—Twenty-sixth, Yankee Division, of
course,” shouted McGee as he slapped O. D.
across his shoulders. “What the hell do you
know about that! I’ll get you assigned to
my battery. Shake, old man, we’ll fight the
rest of this <i>guerre</i> together.”</p>
<p>Jimmy’s words, and the bread and jam
that the Yankee Division V handed out, did
a lot to send the spirits of O. D. shooting up
the ladder of hope. Perhaps the war and the
front wasn’t going to be so terrible, after all
he had read about it. Surely not, if it had a
bunch of fellows up there like Jimmy McGee,
thought O. D.</p>
<p>“Gosh, I was hungry! This stuff is saving
my life,” admitted O. D., gladly, as he left
trailing evidence of the <i>confiture</i> around the
corners of his lips. “Since I got lost from
my detail last night I haven’t had a thing
to eat.... I can’t talk this French, so I
was out of luck for breakfast. I was just
thinking about breaking into this stuff”—and
he showed his emergency rations of “corned
willy” and hardtack—“but the officer told me
that I was not to touch them unless it was
a case of absolute emergency,” concluded
O. D.</p>
<p>“<i>Bon—très-beans!</i> Take his advice, boy:
never touch that stuff unless you are up
against it mighty hard. Just a little of that
embalmed mule will kill any good man. Guess
my stomach got used to it, as I’ve been eatin’
it for damn near six months straight. I’ll get
us a regular feed when we hit a village to-night.
Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>“Can you talk this lingo?” asked O. D., as
if it were beyond possibilities to juggle the
language of the French around on an American
tongue.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, not <i>beaucoup</i>. <i>Cum see—cum saw</i>,”
he replied, indicating a very little bit by his
hands. “But I can <i>parley</i> enough to get a
feed and a place to <i>cushay</i>. You know <i>cushay</i>
means sleep and <i>monjay</i> means eat. That’s
about all you got to know. And <i>combien</i>—that’s
how much. They’ll tell you that <i>toot
sweet</i>.”</p>
<p>“How the dickens do I get a drink of
water?—I’m about dying of thirst. Haven’t
had a drop of water in three days, since we
left the replacement camp.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my God, man! You’re in the wrong
place to get water. The French don’t use
that stuff at all. They think we’re nuts when
we ask for water to drink. You got to get
used to that vinegar that they call <i>van blanc</i>
or <i>van rouge</i>. Here, take a swig of this
stuff.” Jimmy unscrewed the cork from his
French canteen and offered it to O. D.</p>
<p>“What’s in it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, some of their old, rotten <i>van rouge</i>—red
wine, you know. But it’s better than
nothin’.”</p>
<p>O. D. took a swallow, made a hard face and
let a little more go down, then he handed it
back with the remark that it was sour.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, but <i>say la guerre</i>. Gotta get used
to that stuff, I guess,” and he nearly drained
the canteen. “Smoke?” he asked, pulling out
a package of bruised Lucky Strikes.</p>
<p>“No, thanks.”</p>
<p>“You’ll get the habit after you’ve been up
with us awhile. Nothin’ like a cigarette, boy,
in them damp dugouts when you’re waitin’
for some party to come off.”</p>
<p>After the old blue smoke began to issue
from his mouth and nostrils Jimmy felt a
bit talkative.</p>
<p>“So you goin’ to be an artilleryman, eh?”</p>
<p>“Yes; but the funny thing is that I’m an
infantryman—that is, they trained me in that
kind of stuff. I never was on a horse in my
life. Never saw a real cannon, either,” answered
O. D.</p>
<p>“Can that stuff. You don’t need to know
anythin’ about ridin’ a horse in this man’s
army. I joined the artillery to keep from
walkin’ and I’ve been walkin’ most of the
time since I enlisted. We never saw a cannon,
except those pea-shooters we had back
in the States, until we hit France. Just
goes to show how this army’s bein’ run. They
send you up to the artillery and you were
trained for infantry. Soon they’ll be sendin’
up submarine-chasers for caissons,” declared
McGee.</p>
<p>“Say, Jimmy, wish you’d tell me something
about the front, so I’ll know how to act
when I get there,” pleaded O. D.</p>
<p>“Ah, forget that front idea. You’ll never
know the difference—unless, of course, you
get a fistfull of shrapnel in the face or a
bellyful of gas. Course, that makes it different.”</p>
<p>“Shrapnel! Gas! Gee, those are bad
actors up there, I heard. Is it raining shrapnel
all the time, and does the gas come over
every day, or what?” asked O. D. kind of
hopelessly.</p>
<p>“No, it ain’t nothin’ like that, O. D. There
ain’t no flags flyin’ or music playin’ when
the boys go over the top, either. You’re
liable to get a down-pour of shrapnel, a shell-burst,
or a bunch of gas any old time.
There’s no set rules for the way that stuff
comes over—sorta like goin’ to business
every day after you get used to it. A man
gets accustomed to stayin’ up all night and
jugglin’ ninety-five pound shells, firin’ a piece,
or rammin’ bayonets in Boche pigs. The
hunger and cold is about the worst thing.
You’ll drift into the stuff easy enough,” consoled
the Yank.</p>
<p>“Some time, when you get a chance, will
you tell me about some of your experiences
in the war?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>—when I get time, some day,” promised
Jimmy. “Well, are you set for another
little hike? Guess it’s about three
bells. We can make ’bout seven kilometers
before dark and we’ll look for a <i>chambre</i>—that’s
a room in French; then we’ll <i>monjay</i>
and <i>cushay</i>. It’ll never do to hit a town after
dark. You’re out of luck in this country to
find a room or anything once the sun goes
down. They never make a light on account
of Boche planes. Might as well be in a barren
desert as get into a French town after
nightfall.”</p>
<p>“I’m ready,” answered O. D., buckling up
his harness and rising.</p>
<p>“It takes me quite a bit of time to get all
of this junk on me,” apologized McGee, as
he began throwing <i>musettes</i> over his shoulders
and buckling on belts and other stuff.
O. D. gave him a hand and pretty soon Jimmy
McGee was once more arrayed in all the
glory of a front-line veteran.</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll hang onto this hunk of <i>du
pan</i>. It’s mighty hard to get bread in these
French places,” said McGee, falling into the
old stride that he patronized when on the
stem in France.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER II—“AVEY VOUS DE CHAMBRE?”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>Jimmy McGee and O. D., alias William
G. Preston, made a great contrast as they
plodded up and down hill along the tree-lined
route over which passed in 1914 the stream
of Paris taxicabs that brought French poilus
to the heights of Verdun in time for Papa
Joffre to stop the mad advance of the Prussians.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, O. D., with his regulation
pack and uniform equipment, would most
likely have been immediately picked for the
better soldier of the two. Jimmy McGee,
habitué of the ragged battle-lines, and showing
the wear and tear of fighting in everything
about him, save his eyes, would have
been dubbed a slouch. Which just goes to
prove how different are the standards of
measurements and worth that obtain at the
front and in the S. O. S. Everything and
everybody at the front is discounted until
nothing but naked realities show. There is
no chance for the superficial to flourish in
the trenches and gun positions.</p>
<p>The pair had made about three kilometers
when the sound of an approaching auto
warned Jimmy McGee to take to the bushes.
He lost no time in getting off the road. O. D.
followed him with the statement that he believed
it was a general’s limousine coming.</p>
<p>“Let it come—we don’t need to see it.
Just sit down and look the other way. No
use tryin’ to break our arms with that
salutin’ stuff,” was the reply.</p>
<p>Both men sat down facing the woods.
There was a sound of tires scraping the road,
under pressure of quickly applied brakes. A
door opened and slammed shut.</p>
<p>“What outfit are you men from?” The
question was asked in a heavy, steady voice.</p>
<p>McGee and O. D. stood up and faced about
to find themselves confronted by a major-general.
They saluted. McGee spoke up.</p>
<p>“Twenty-sixth Division, sir.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing straggling along this
road?” asked the general.</p>
<p>“Just returnin’ to our outfits from the
hospital, sir,” lied McGee, with a feeling of
glory.</p>
<p>“All right, men.”</p>
<p>The man with two stars on his shoulders
stepped back into the warmth and luxury of
his chugging motor and was off in a swirl
of dust that nearly choked the two soldiers.
McGee caught himself in the act of reaching
for his old, battle-scarred gas-mask.</p>
<p>“Gee! he was a major-general,” declared
O. D. in an awed voice; “did you see the two
stars on his straps?” gasped the newcomer
to Jimmy’s hunting-grounds.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, I noticed them all right, but they
didn’t mean nothin’ to me. Generals don’t
count much up there,” pointing in the general
direction of the front. “We see plenty
of other things that’s more interestin’.
Course, you know, I generally salute officers
from brigadier-generals up—that is, when
they see me first; but you get used to havin’
’em around you,” was Jimmy’s rejoinder.</p>
<p>“First time I ever had a general speak to
me,” admitted O. D.</p>
<p>“Hell afire! I’ve had a dozen of ’em talk
to me. Old General Edwards—he’s our boss,
you know, and some boy at that, too—gave
me an awful bawlin’-out one day on a hike
when he caught me ridin’ on the rollin’
kitchen. Then another time he came into my
dug-out one day and told me that the C. O.
had said something good about a fool stunt
I pulled one night when our lines went down
and we kept up communication durin’ the
bombardment and attack. Said he’d cite me,
or somethin’ like that, but I never bothered
to find out much about the business. Believe
me, Edwards is the kind of man this army
needs with a general’s stars on. He gets
right in the old <i>guerre</i>. Some of ’em fight
the war back in towns that the Boches have
agreed not to shell. Say, by the way, ever
see Pershing down in the S. O. S.?” asked
Jimmy, as he got started under way again.</p>
<p>“Yes, once, when some French general
gave him a medal or something. It was quite
a ceremony,” replied his new companion.</p>
<p>“What did he look like? Kinda curious,
as I ain’t seen him yet.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that you are right at the
front and never see the general?” The question
was crowded with incredulity.</p>
<p>“Been on every front the Americans ever
fought on, except the British lines, and never
seen Pershing yet,” maintained McGee.</p>
<p>“Whee-ew! I thought that he was at the
front all of the time leading the troops,” said
O. D.</p>
<p>“No that Civil War stuff ain’t much in
this <i>guerre</i>. Generals are like the flags and
bands at the time we go over—they ain’t
there, as a rule,” informed the man who knew
about those things.</p>
<p>“Three kilometers to Issoncourt, according
to that mile-stone,” said O. D. after they
had hiked about four more kilos.</p>
<p>“Don’t believe those things. Next one
will say seven kilometers to Issoncourt.
That’s the way they build those things in
this country. You ’ain’t arrived over here
until you get there.”</p>
<p>“Looks like a nice town over yonder.” O.
D. illustrated his words by pointing to the
cluster of red roofs that glared in the afternoon
sunlight.</p>
<p>“Looks—but that’s all. They’re all alike.
At a distance you think these darn French
villages are the cat’s knee-knuckles, so to
speak, but when you get in them it’s the
same old stuff—a bunch of old, moss-covered
buildings standin’ around a church that’s big
enough for an Irish parish in a big New
York City precinct. A gang of cows in the
street; an army of sheep and goats runnin’
in and out of front doors; a few hungry-looking
dogs; <i>beaucoup</i> manure smoking in
front of every door; some old men and
women clatterin’ up and down in those
wooden shoes—and you’ve got the best
French village I ever stayed in. I’d rather
pass the rest of my life in Yulee, Florida,
than spend three months in one of these
places durin’ peace-times. There’s a few
trains pass through Yulee, and you get a
newspaper once in a while; but in these
French dumps the biggest excitement is that
old village crier with his drum and line of
talk that the inhabitants can’t <i>compree</i>, or
a two-year-old newspaper posted up on the
city hall, or <i>Mairie</i>, as they call it. I’m off
’em for life.”</p>
<p>It was only four o’clock when the pair
reached Issoncourt, but already the shades
of oncoming night had started to curtain the
early autumn day with a sort of purple haze
that soon became a regular night mist.</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll camp here for the night,”
was Jimmy’s decision, as he noted the signs
of night coming.</p>
<p>Issoncourt had been attached to the sides
of the main Verdun road, and everything
that the town owned was in plain view from
the middle of the street, or <i>Grande Rue</i>, as
the villagers called the roadway.</p>
<p>“Looks like there might be a <i>chambre</i> in
that house. We’ll reconnoiter a bit for a
place to <i>cushay</i>,” and Jimmy started toward
what he thought was the best-looking house
on the street.</p>
<p>Just as they reached the rough stone steps,
after wading through the usual three feet of
mud, a young colt came tearing through a
barn door and nearly sent O. D. down for
the count. Jimmy tapped at the door.</p>
<p>“<i>Entrez</i>,” called a woman’s voice.</p>
<p>McGee pushed the door in and both men
stepped into the room. It was the same old
stuff to Jimmy. The room was big and contained
two beds that were built into the walls
and canopied over with some kind of red
curtain. A rickety table with a half-emptied
bottle of <i>vin rouge</i> on it stood in the center
of the room. There was the usual number
of chickens passing in and out to the barn.
Several cats lounged about the great open
fireplace that was bare of fire, except for a
few pieces of smoking things that looked
like grape-vines. A dog got up somewhere
in the darkness and shook himself back to
life. The woman who had told them to enter
was not in sight.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sound of wooden shoes rattling
over stones announced the approach of
some one. A woman came in from the barn
carrying an apron full of potatoes and
greens. A small army of chickens followed
at a respectful distance. The woman was of
medium height, kind of pudgy around the
gills and places where a corset should have
been. Her hands were red and big enough
to handle any one-hundred-and-sixty-pound
man. Of course, she wasn’t good-looking or
particularly ugly, just an ordinary peasant
face.</p>
<p>“<i>Que désirez-vous, Messieurs?</i>” (What
will you have, messieurs?)</p>
<p>“Eh—<i>bonjour, madame</i>,” began Jimmy,
unsteadily. “<i>Avey vouse de chambre for
comrade</i> and <i>moi</i>?”</p>
<p>The woman cocked her ear to get the drift.
“<i>Chambre—pour coucher?</i>” she asked.</p>
<p>“Ah, <i>oui, madame</i>,” assured Jimmy, picking
up courage.</p>
<p>The woman dropped her load of potatoes
and greens on the floor, kicked off the wooden
boats, and, telling them to follow her, waddled
into the next and only room in the house.</p>
<p>“<i>Voilà!</i>” (There), she exclaimed, pointing
to a bed that was at least seven feet high.</p>
<p>“<i>Bon—tres-beans, madame</i>,” to the woman.
Then Jimmy turned to O. D.: “We may need
a step-ladder to get in and a pulley to get us
out; but <i>say la guerre</i>. It’s a hundred times
better than a hay-loft.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said O. D., enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“<i>Madame, monjay ici?</i>” was Jimmy’s next
effort.</p>
<p>“<i>Mais, messieurs, je n’ai rien! Trés-difficile
d’obtenir quoi que ce soit depuis la
guerre! Figuerez-vous, une livre de sucre
pour une personne par mois! Et du pain!
O là là! C’est terrible, vous comprenz?</i>” (Oh,
messieurs, I have very little. Too difficult to
get things since the war started. One pound
of sugar a person for a month, a ration of
bread. It’s terrible, you understand?), answered
the woman, evasively.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui, madame, compree</i>; but <i>comrade, moi</i>,
no <i>monjay. Beaucoup hungry. Beaucoup
fatigue. Compree?</i>” questioned McGee, tapping
his stomach as if it were an empty bag.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>,” answered the <i>madame</i>, solemnly.</p>
<p>“<i>Omelette, pom du tear fritz, trey-bon vous,
serve comrade, moi, s’il vous plate.</i>” Jimmy
did his darnest to tell her what he was thinking.</p>
<p>She understood him after the fashion of
the French people who had been near American
soldiers before. Most of the peasants in
the regions where many American soldiers
were located soon learned to speak their native
French just as brokenly as the Americans.
It was necessary to do so in order that
the likes of Jimmy McGee might <i>compree</i> just
a little bit.</p>
<p>After much puffing and running around,
the woman finally set a table for her hungry
guests. A fifteen-egg omelet, <i>beaucoup</i>
French-fried potatoes, what was left of Jimmy’s
bread, a dish of white cheese, and a tall
bottle of wine awaited the offensive of the
two Americans.</p>
<p>“Ah, <i>madame</i>,” said McGee, licking his
chops, “I’ll say that’s the <i>darb</i>——”</p>
<p>“<i>Qu’est-ce qu’il dit?</i>” (What did you say?)</p>
<p>“Oh, I said its mighty <i>bon—beaucoup monjay</i>,
you <i>compree moi</i>?”</p>
<p>The peasant woman smiled at him as if
she understood, and Jimmy made a dive into
the middle of the big yellow omelet.</p>
<p>“Gee, this is the best feed I’ve sat down
to in a long, long time,” admitted O. D. as he
piled the brown potatoes knee-deep in his
plate. “Wish I could speak French like you
do, I’d be able to keep from starving.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t <i>parley</i> much, just enough to
get along. Course, I never have any time
to study. If we get a chance I’ll teach you
some of the stuff.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Say, wonder if you could get her
to give me a drink of water. I’ll pass away
with this thirst.”</p>
<p>“Here, take a glass of the <i>vin rouge</i>. It
may be better than the stuff I had in my
canteen,” offered Jimmy.</p>
<p>“No, believe I’d rather have the water,
if you can get it without too much trouble.”</p>
<p>“None t’all. Wait ’till the madame blows
in again; I’ll see what we can do.”</p>
<p>“<i>Madame, avey vous der low?</i>” asked Jimmy,
hoping that she would get his meaning.</p>
<p>“<i>Der low</i>,” repeated the woman, lost for
a moment. “<i>Der low</i>,” again. This time with
great wondering, “<i>Pas compris, monsieur</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>Cum see, cum saw</i>,” explained McGee,
raising an empty glass to his lips.</p>
<p>“<i>Oh, pardon, monsieur, pardon, oui, tout
de suite.</i>” She hurried over to the wall and
pulled a part of it out, found a cupboard
where nobody else would have ever dreamed
there was one, and drew forth a glass. She
brought the glass to Jimmy and gave it to
him.</p>
<p>“She didn’t get me,” groaned Jimmy.
“Thought I wanted another glass, just like a
Frog.” Then to the woman, “<i>Madame, compree
low, der low</i>, drink, you <i>savvy</i>?” he
floundered deeper.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head while McGee
scanned the room in search of a pump or
something by which he might readily explain
his desire. There was nothing in sight to
help him. He turned again to the waiting
woman.</p>
<p>“<i>Madame, moi comrade—no van rouge</i>—no
<i>pas bon</i> for <i>comrade</i>. <i>Kisskesay, der low</i>,
water, in <i>Fransay</i>?” Jimmy was at the
limit of his resources.</p>
<p>“Never mind, old man, I’ll go without it,”
said O. D., coming to the rescue.</p>
<p>“<i>Der low, der low</i>,” muttered the woman
shaking her head uncomprehendingly and
pronouncing the word just as Jimmy had
done. Suddenly a light flashed across her
stolid features.</p>
<p>“<i>De l’eau, vous dites.</i>” (Water you said.)</p>
<p>“<i>Oui, Oui, madame.</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>Ah, mon Dieu, de l’eau, je comprends</i>,”
and she dashed out of doors with a small
bucket.</p>
<p>“At last she gets it—some battlin’, though.
These doggone French people can’t <i>compree</i>
this water stuff. Maybe if they’d drink more
water the war’d be won faster. But I’m getting
just like ’em—haven’t had any water in
four days myself now. Guess I’ll tank up
to-night.”</p>
<p>Madame returned with the water and immediately
poured it all in a basin, grabbed
some soap and a towel and brought the whole
outfit over to Jimmy.</p>
<p>“<i>Voilà!</i>” she exclaimed as if the <i>guerre</i> was
won.</p>
<p>Jimmy looked at the basin, the soap and
towel. Then he looked long and hard at O. D.
The woman stood fast, regarding them both,
feeling suddenly guilty of having sinned
again.</p>
<p>“Corporal of the guard, relief, post number
one,” shouted Jimmy. “Can you beat that,
wouldn’t it drive a man nuts? I ask for a
drink of water and the woman insists that I
wash. No use, O. D.” Then to the woman,
“<i>Madame, pas wash, cum saw</i>,” and he lifted
the glass to his lips for the second time.</p>
<p><i>“Quoi? Boire de l’eau? Impossible!!
Buvez donc du vin! quelle race! Eh! mon
Dieu! ils bovvent de l’eau!</i>” (What! you
want water to drink. Impossible. Drink the
red wine. What people—what people! My
God! they drink water), exclaimed the mystified
woman, and she nearly went into fits.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui, madame</i>,” insisted Jimmy, raising
the glass up and down as if to convince her
by that action of the sincerity of his words
and meaning.</p>
<p>“<i>Comme vous voulent, messieurs!</i>” (As
you will then, messieurs), answered madame,
and she went out for more water.</p>
<p>Just as the boys were hitting the cheese
or <i>fromage</i> course as Jimmy insisted on calling
it, the man of the house, or <i>patron</i>, as
madame called him, blew in. He was nothing
more and nothing less than a grizzled old
poilu rigged up in civilian clothes.</p>
<p>“<i>Bon swoir, messieurs</i>,” was his hearty
greeting.</p>
<p>“<i>Bonjour, monsieur</i>,” responded Jimmy,
rising to shake his hand.</p>
<p>“<i>Bonne mangee?</i>” asked the Frenchman,
pointing to the table.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui ... trey-bien</i>,” declared McGee, and
he let out two notches in his belt to prove
that he was well fed.</p>
<p>The old man dragged up a chair and made
believe he was going to roll a cigarette.
Jimmy saw the act and got wise.</p>
<p>“Here, have a regular cigarette,” he said,
extending a pack of Piedmonts to the <i>patron</i>.</p>
<p>“<i>Merci. Merci, monsieur.</i>”</p>
<p>“Take ’em all. I can get more. Suppose
we ain’t too near the front yet for the
Y. M. C. A.”</p>
<p>“<i>Ah, monsieur, vous êtes très?-gentil, très
bon.</i>” (Ah, sir, you are very nice, very kind.)</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>Once the cigarette was lighted, the man of
the house waddled over to the cupboard and
extracted a long dark bottle. He came back
to the table, measured out four glasses of
brownish-looking stuff and handed them
around. He touched his own against every
one else’s and shouted:</p>
<p>“<i>Vive l’Amérique!</i>”</p>
<p>“<i>Vive la France!</i>” shouted Jimmy.</p>
<p>The old cognac went down at a swallow.
Everyone smacked their lips except O. D. He
busied himself brushing away two big tears
that filled his eyes.</p>
<p>“<i>Bon</i>,” grunted the Frenchman.</p>
<p>“<i>Ah, oui</i>,” answered Jimmy, patting his
stomach.</p>
<p>“<i>Mangee</i>,” said the husband. He sat down
with his wife to a meal of soup, with bread
floating around in it, a dish of boiled potatoes,
bread, cheese, and wine.</p>
<p>“Want to show you something, Jimmy,”
said O. D., rising and getting an envelope out
of his blouse. He spread a lot of pictures in
front of Jimmy.</p>
<p>“That’s mother, in her little rose-garden.
This is Mary, always loved flowers, too. See
she’s hiding behind some tall lilies, just so
you can see her face.”</p>
<p>“Gee, I can’t tell the difference between
Mary and the lilies,” interrupted Jimmy, admiringly,
as he looked upon the picture of
Mary’s sweet, girlish face. “Golly! it must
be pippin stuff to have a sister like that.”</p>
<p>“Here’s some more of Mary, taken on the
front stoop and one at the shore when I took
her down there to go swimming one hot day.”</p>
<p>Jimmy was so absorbed looking at Mary’s
pictures that he didn’t hear the madame’s
inquisitive question.</p>
<p>“<i>Fiancée, fiancée?</i>” she asked, pointing
to Mary’s photo.</p>
<p>“No,” answered Jimmy at last, “sister,
<i>compree</i>? <i>Sœur</i> to <i>comrade</i>,” pointing to
O. D., who nodded his head in affirmation.</p>
<p>The snap of Mary taken on the beach fascinated
Jimmy. He decided it should belong
to him. When O. D. was not watching, the
Yank who never let Boche shells or gas worry
him swept the picture under his blouse with
a strange feeling of unrest running through
his body and soul.</p>

<p>“Well, time the <i>guerre</i> started I meant to

McGee.</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“Back in the old States I used to be a little
two-by-four newspaper man ’round New York—scribbled
a few lines about murders, scandals,
subway accidents, and wrote up a lot
of stuff ’bout people who pulled wild stunts
to get their names in print. Ever since I
left my home down in Florida five years ago,
after my folks all died and I was alone in
this so-called cruel world, I had a hankering
for adventure. Used to travel ’round quite
a bit, and finally landed in New York as a
cub reporter. Stayed there awhile and got so
I could make my own livin’ as a newspaper
man. Then the war started.</p>
<p>“Naturally I wanted to go to France <i>toot
sweet</i>. Always was kinda romantic—so much
so till I thought seriously of goin’ into the
movies once or twice—that along with the
adventure-bug and natural-born desire to take
a good crack at them dirty Heinies sent me
up to a recruitin’-station to get some dope
about joinin’ the army.</p>
<p>“About that time I got a telegram to beat
it for Providence. A friend of mine who was
a captain in the Coast Artillery said that he
had a good job in the army for me. I shot
over to Providence and went down to the
fort where the captain’s outfit was located.
The job hadn’t come through when I arrived,
so while waitin’ I became correspondent for
<i>The Providence Journal</i>.</p>
<p>“Three months passed and the job—I was
to be sergeant-major of the post, with promise
of an early commission—hadn’t materialized.
I got mighty itchy to be a soldier.
Folks used to look at me and wonder why I
wasn’t wearin’ khaki instead of white flannels
and silk shirts, so I thought, anyhow.</p>
<p>“Finally the job came through—I was to
enlist on August eleventh. The night before
I started down to Providence to see some
friends and say <i>au revoir</i>. On the way I ran
into a column of field artillery headed for a
railroad station.</p>
<p>“Where you fellows goin’?” I asked.</p>
<p>“To France,” answered a little corporal.</p>
<p>“To France,” says I to myself a couple of
times, and I’m going to take a plush-lined job
down at a Coast Artillery fort. Never do it.
Sure enough two hours later, me, my white
flannels, silk shirt, and dinky Panama was on
board a flat ridin’ toward Boxford, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>“That night I <i>cushayed</i> on the ground with
a horse-blanket for coverin’. Great God!
Thought I’d freeze to death before the bugle
blew to quit <i>cushayin’</i>. Next mornin’ I was
sworn in. For three days I drilled, dressed
up in my white pants and seashore outfit.
They didn’t have a uniform big enough for
me. Gee, it was funny for everybody but
me. Finally I got a pair of breeches that
wouldn’t split everytime I tried to get in ’em.</p>
<p>“We got <i>beaucoup</i> of that squad’s east and
double-time stuff there. Then came an order
for my battalion to <i>partee</i> for Newport News,
Virginia.</p>
<p>“Down there they put us doin’ guard duty
over a few miles of wild horses and hungry
mules. Stayed there a month and a half.
Then we got orders. That’s how I got in this
man’s army,” concluded Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Gee, you’re the most interesting fellow
I ever met. Don’t quit now. How did you
come across?”</p>
<p>“One Saturday afternoon me, George
Neil, and Sundberg was sittin’ in a theater
watchin’ some guys fall in and out of stale
slapstick stuff when a gink, the manager, I
guess, blew out on the stage between acts and
said that all men in the One Hundred and
Third Field Artillery must report <i>toot sweet</i>
in front of the house.”</p>
<p><i>“Monsieur, voulez-vous coucher maintenant?</i>”
(Will you sleep now?) interrupted the
madame.</p>
<p><i>“Oui</i>,” replied Jimmy, making a move to
get up.</p>
<p><i>“Peu importe! Restez donc près du feu!</i>”
(It does not make any difference. Stay by
the fire if you are not ready to go.)</p>
<p><i>“Merci, madame</i>,” and Jimmy sat down
again.</p>
<p>The old man was jerked out of his snoring
slumber. With little less ado than to shake
off his slippers and take off his coat the old
fellow climbed into bed, pants, cap, and everything
else on. His spouse went ahead with
her preparations for sleep as if the two
Americans had been miles away.</p>
<p>“Just like these people. They don’t give
a darn for any one,” explained Jimmy as he
started to scratch around his neck and chest.
“Damn these cooties, they always get restless
when I stay near a hot fire long.” He
pushed farther away from the fireplace and
put a cigarette to his lips.</p>
<p>“Go on, Jimmy, with your story. You were
told to leave the house—and what then?”
begged O. D.</p>
<p>“Well, I reported in front of the theater
and a sergeant grabs me and says, ‘Git in
that truck and go to camp.’ ‘What the hell’s
up?’ I asked. ‘Never mind, you’ll find out
soon enough,’ snaps out the sergeant.</p>
<p>“When we hit the camp half of the battery
was lined up gettin’ inspected and the
other half was fallin’ all over each other,
rollin’ up blankets or cussin’ the supply sergeant
because he wouldn’t issue stuff that
had been swiped or lost. Tacks McLoughlin,
who used to <i>cushay</i> next to me in the tent,
told me that my detail was goin’ to France
<i>toot sweet</i>.</p>
<p>“You can imagine that the news kind of
excited me just a little, ’cause I was green
to real excitement in those days. I started
to make up my own roll, but when it came
time to strap it up I found that I was tyin’
up my own arm inside the roll, so had to unwind
the whole darn thing. Finally I got all
set and was inspected. Nobody tried to stop
me from goin’, so I guess I was thought able
and fit. <i>Toot sweet</i> after we <i>monjayed</i> a rotten
supper of goolash—some meal to hand a
gang about to come to this God-forsaken
country—the gang started bettin’ like a bunch
of wild men at a horse-race.</p>
<p>“‘Bet we’ll get torpedoed,’ shouted one
crape-hanger. ‘Ten to one we’ll be at the
front in two months,’ said Sundberg, goin’
wild. I told him to lay dead on that stuff. I
knew there wasn’t much chance of ’em sendin’
a gang of men who didn’t know a halter-shank
from the breech-block of a piece to
the front right away. One gink wanted to bet
me that he’d get hit before me. I listened to
the bull just to keep my excitement down.</p>
<p>“The trucks rolled up about eight bells and
we all piled in on top of one another and
started for the ship. It didn’t take long to
get down to the pier and we were loaded on
like a bunch of cattle.</p>
<p>“We just followed the man in front of us
up and down, in and around all of the decks
on that cussed boat until, at last, somebody
found the way down to what they had rigged
up as our quarters. Time I stuck my nose
down that companionway I knew that somethin’
was wrong—smelled just like the horse
and mule corrals that we had been guardin’.
Finally I landed on the last deck, which was
at least fifty feet below daylight, and reached
my bunk, which was jammed up close to the
rear of another mule—I mean a mule’s stall.
I swore like a sailor and some funny guy
who knew a little bit of French bawled out,
‘<i>Say la guerre</i>,’ which I understand pretty
well now, even if I didn’t know what he was
talkin’ about then.</p>
<p>“Well, O. D., you know a mule don’t smell
like a flower-garden and when you put sixty
mules and fifty men in a rat-hole, ’way below
fresh air and daylight, there ain’t goin’ to be
any perfumery-shop made by doin’ so. Boy,
that was one hell of a night. Gas ain’t in it
with the fumes that filled that bunking-place.
When I woke up in the mornin’ my old bean
was so heavy I thought I was wearin’ a cast-iron
derby. I believe I’d have suffocated if
it wasn’t for a trick that some wise bird
played on Johnson, who <i>cushayed</i> in the bunk
above. You see, our tier of torture-racks
was right below one of those air-funnels, or
whatever you call them things on ships that
look like big question-marks. ’Bout midnight
the funny guy lets a whole bucket of cold
water go down that funnel. Course Johnny
got most of it in the stomach, but I got
enough to kinda revive me.</p>
<p>“Soon as I woke up I thought we was out
to sea. I felt sick enough to be in the middle
of the ocean, but some guy who had been
up on deck hollered down that we hadn’t
moved a foot from the dock. Sundberg, who
had been talkin’ about the motion of the boat,
had to crawl under a bunk after that.</p>
<p>“The first day on the boat was enough to
make me believe that we would all be starved
to death before gettin’ to France. They had
a Chinese steward named Yung Kow, and
that slant-eyed chink hid most of the stuff we
were supposed to eat.</p>
<p>“His parents would have turned in their
grave if they only knew how well his name
fitted him. Too bad pig ain’t a Chinese word.
Young pig would have been better than Yung
Kow. The third night out we caught him and
three more almond-eyed cooks storin’ the
stuff down in a hold. Didn’t do a thing but
turn the deck hose on the crew of ’em.</p>
<p>“Before we started loadin’ them wild jackasses
and horses on I had a chance to pike
the tub off that was to take us across. It
was an old Hawaiian line freighter named the
<i>Panaman</i>. Seemed to be a fair-looking ship—but
none too big for nine hundred mules, ninety-nine
horses, and two hundred men.</p>
<p>“I was talkin’ to a cannibal named Punkjaw
who had been a sailor ever since he quit
eatin’ people four years before. He couldn’t
speak much English, but could sputter some
words in Spanish, and as I took a correspondence
course in that lingo I got about
every tenth word. Along came Bill O’Rourke,
actin’ top-kicker, and tells me to haul it
down on the dock and lead a few mules
aboard. I dragged along and started to do
as he said.</p>
<p>“But listen here, O. D., you know a mule
is one of them persons a man can’t lead any
too easy. The first long-eared brat that I got
didn’t have no intention of goin’ to France—not
if he could help it. I took the halter-shank
and went as far up that gangway as the
slack of my rope let me. Then I stopped.
A mule, ’specially these army ones, is stronger
than most men. That fellow I had was a
regular Goliath. He just stood there like a
statue. Well, I pulled and cussed about ten
minutes and got a nigger-boy to wallop that
brute over the hind with a thick plank. Nothin’
doin’.</p>
<p>“That mule was a slacker. He just wasn’t
goin’ to France and fight. You know how
aggravatin’ a top-sergeant, more so an actin’
one, can be. ‘Git on that rope and drag your
mule up; you’re holdin’ up the ship,’ bawls
O’Rourke. Can you imagine that stuff from a
man like O’Rourke, who had spent quite a bit
o’ time with mules and knew their tricks.
‘Git on the rope yourself,’ I shot back. See,
I’d only been in the army a little time and a
top-sergeant didn’t seem like no tin god to
me.</p>
<p>“Course O’Rourke was sore as a boil. But
he couldn’t do nothin’. We got a detail at
the head and stern of that critter and when
somebody counted three everybody yanked
and pushed. The damn mule stood fast, but
Berny Garrity and another guy went overboard
while several others landed on different
bales of cotton nearby. We got some
coons to help us. Them niggers shouted like
madmen in a side-show. But nothin’ didin’.
Finally we hooked that fool mule onto a
pulley with <i>beaucoup</i> ropes and hauled him
aboard. It was a battle to get that gink in
his stall.</p>
<p>“The ship was loaded and ready to start
to France at three bells that afternoon.
’Bout four we pulled up the anchor and got
under way. When we got so far out into the
ocean that shore was just like a low cloud in
the west I said, ‘Good-by, old America.’
Thought I’d never see the United States for
many moons again. Can you imagine us
wakin’ up the next mornin’ in plain sight of
Jersey coast? We did—and went into New
York Harbor for a convoy.</p>
<p>“After waitin’ thirty-six hours they finally
got all of the tubs in a line that was to
go across with us. I never saw such a fleet
of fishin’-smacks and whalers in all my life.
There wasn’t one that could make over seven
miles an hour, except ourselves, as we soon
found out.</p>
<p>“The Statue of Liberty was about the last
friend I seen as we pulled out of New York
and hit for the briny. That night we were
out to sea for fair and the <i>Panaman</i> did some
stunts that would make a good Holy Roller
feel ashamed.</p>
<p>“Can’t say that our trip was as bad as it
might have been. Course I got out of that
hole they stuck us in for sleepin’-quarters
and made a bunk upon the second hatch, ’midships.
Sundberg and I slept together there
and we used to rope ourselves down at night
to keep from rollin’ overboard. The eatin’
was rotten for us, but the mules and horses
ate pretty fair, that is, all but mine. I had
eighteen soft-brained, long-eared mules to
feed, and they got so damn mean until they
would bite my back when I turned ’round to
pick up hay. So I starved ’em a few times
just to show ’em who was runnin’ their little
boardin’-house.</p>
<p>“There wasn’t any amusements on that
boat. Not even a checker-board or a game of
tiddledy-de-winks. In that case we had to
shoot crap quite a bit. Generally the whole
outfit includin’ the crew, galley hounds, and
even Punkjaw, shot all mornin’ long and after
dinner we <i>encored</i> until dark. The games got
so high and interestin’ until the ship’s officers
and some army lieutenants got a few hands
in. That’s how I met Lindsey, the third
engineer. He and I got chummy over a
couple of good hands that ran for me almost
half an hour and first thing I knew I had
fixed to sleep in his stateroom on the little
sofa thing in there.</p>
<p>“’Bout that time I made friends with
Julius. He served the captain’s mess and
used to hand me in a feed every meal through
the port-hole. Talk about good <i>monjayin’</i>.
Boy, them was the days when a dish of ham
and eggs looked like a mess-kit full of ‘corn
willy.’ Them officers used to get chicken
almost every meal. Course I <i>monjayed</i> just
as good as they did when that chink steward
didn’t have his heads on Julius.</p>
<p>“The only ceremonies that took place on
board was funerals. We had quite a few
mules die, and of course there wasn’t much
use in carryin’ them along like that. A dead
mule ain’t much account hitched up to a ration
cart or a rollin’ kitchen. So we hauled
’em up and let ’em slide overboard. There
was a couple of guys who hollered about doin’
that, as they said German submarines might
track us or find out that there was boats
around if they saw dead mules floatin’ on the
ocean. But I told those fellows that it would
be a darn sight easier to locate us if we kept
the mules on board than if we threw ’em over.</p>
<p>“After fifteen days of rollin’ and pitchin’
we sneaked into the danger zone, as that place
was called where there was supposed to be
<i>beaucoup</i> U-boats. Funny thing, but you
never heard a word ’bout submarines until
we hit the zone. Then the only thing said
was that we might have to swim a good deal
if we got hit, as most of the boats were not
seaworthy. Still we kept on drillin’ with them
just as if they were good enough to get in if
the ship got torpedoed.</p>
<p>“Our third day in the zone, after the little
toy-boats, or destroyers as they called them,
bobbed up, gave us a little fun. One of the
guys on watch—that’s the same thing as
guard in this man’s army—swore he saw a
submarine on the starboard railin’ or somethin’
like that. Everybody rushed to that
side of the ship until we like to have tipped
over. You might think that we would have
had sense enough, knowin’ it was a German
submarine, to have ducked behind something
so as to get out of the way of anythin’ that
the Dutchmen would shoot over. But no, just
like Americans, they had to run out and see
what was goin’ on.</p>
<p>“The captain had ’em blow the bugle to
call everybody, ’cept the gunners and crew,
to the life-boats. ’Bout the time that the
racket started Samson and me was just gettin’
away with a big pan full of bread-puddin’
that the chinks and Japs had made for their
own dinner. I heard ’em yellin’, ‘Submarine,
submarine!’ But hell, I didn’t want to lose
that puddin’, not after gettin’ away so clean,
so Samson and I ran down the ladder that
goes from the smokestack room down to the
hold and hid the stuff. When I got upstairs—I
mean on deck again—the bow-gun crew had
a gun trained on the German and banged
away once or twice. Some of the fellows
swear that they saw the wake of a torpedo
’way behind us as if the Boche had fell short
by a good many yards. But guess they was
seein’ things.</p>
<p>“That was the last fun we had until we hit
the harbor of Brest after bein’ at sea twenty-three
days. A Frenchman pilot got on
aboard. Believe me it was a hell of a funny
thing—he couldn’t speak a word of English
and none of the officers could say a line of
French. In them days I was just as bad as
the officers as I couldn’t even say good mornin’
or ask for a drink of water in the Frog
stuff. They got a buck private by the name
of St. Gabriel or somethin’ like that who was
a French Canuck to parley for them. That
was one day that the privates had the officers
at parade rest. Gabriel was the only man
that knew what was up beside the pilot, and
they had each other bluffed I believe. Well,
buddy, that’s how I got to this sunny France
business. Sunny! We ain’t had two whole
clear days since we hit the country.” Jimmy
McGee started running his hand under his
shirt and scratched away in a professional
manner.</p>
</div>
<div class='chapter' id='ch_IV'>
<div class='c'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER IV—“SUNNY FRANCE!”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“You sure had a tough time getting here,
Jimmy, compared to me. I came over
on an old ocean liner. We had good clean
bunks and three settings at table. There
were regular bill o’ fares and live waiters.
Only took eight days to come over. What
was your first impression of France and
where did you land at Brest?” O. D.’s brown
eyes didn’t show a bit of sleepiness and his
ears were cocked for every word that Jimmy
McGee was willing to spill.</p>
<p>“Hell, no—not at Brest, that must have
been a good town in them days. There was
a rule made at the beginning of the war not
to give this division anything good. We
stayed in Brest that night and started for St.
Nazaire <i>toot sweet</i> the next day. God help
anybody, even the M. P.’s who had to fight
the <i>guerre</i> in St. Nazaire. That town is the
first place the Lord made and He forgot about
it ten minutes after putting it up. It’s worse
than the town old Bill Blodgett comes from.</p>
<p>“Well, we got in the harbor there ’bout two
o’clock. It was kinda foggy and rainin’ off
and on. ’Ain’t quit since then. Still they
call it ‘Sunny France.’ After a lot of waitin’
around they shoved us in the canal locks,
and I’m a liar if we didn’t go right through
the middle of the town. Some of the houses on
both sides of the locks looked like twins or
else as if they had been pushed apart so as
the canal could run through the town.</p>
<p>“Guess the first impression I got was that
the Americans was still a new play toy for
the French, ’cause there was a gang of kids
and people runnin’ up and down the docks
shoutin’ and wavin’ to us. Then I began to
notice the buildings—whew! They looked old
enough to be great-grandfathers to some of
those four-hundred-year-old houses down in
St. Augustine, Florida. Most of ’em had
<i>Café</i> or <i>Van Rouge</i> written all over them. I
never saw so many <i>cafés</i> in all my life.
Course the French people looked funny as hell
to us. Some were all dolled up in fine clothes
and others looked as if they would catch cold
for want of somethin’ to cover them. There
was more soldiers walkin’ up and down on the
piers than we had in the whole American
army at that time. I thought we must be
pretty near the front as there was so many.
Some of the Frenchmen wore helmets. That’s
about all that most of the Frogs have got
left now. Never saw so many widows in all
my days. Most of the women who was
dressed up at all wore black and long veils.
They made me think ’bout the war, and I
felt kinda good ’cause there wasn’t any
woman to wear black in case I got knocked
off at the front.</p>
<p>“Some Americans, who acted as though
they had just bought the town and could end
the war with a snap of their fingers, came
down to the edge of the locks and began shootin’
the bull. Most of the Americans wanted
to know how the football games were coming
off in the States. We told them we didn’t
know as they hadn’t started good when we
left. I had to explain to one guy that we
didn’t come over on an express and that it
took nearly a month to get here. He began
tellin’ me where we could get our money
changed and where the best champagne was
and how to do things in general while in
France. I asked him if he had been to the
front yet and he said, ‘Oh no, I’m a receivin’-clerk,
with the grade of corporal.’ ‘The hell
you are! I thought you had been up endin’
the war,’ says I. But he didn’t seem to get
my meanin’.</p>
<p>“They kept us on that boat two days.
Durin’ that time some little French kids who
could <i>parley</i> a little English rowed out in a
tub and sold us <i>beaucoup van rouge</i> and
<i>cognac</i>. About half of the ship got zig-zag
<i>toot sweet</i>. I thought they’d put us in irons.</p>
<p>“Finally we got marched ashore and
through the town to our barracks. Some barracks
for a white man I’ll say. No bunks.
No floor. No stoves. Nothing but a roof
and the ground. It comes easy now to <i>cushay</i>
on a bag of ten-penny nails, but in them days
sleepin’ on the cold bumpy ground was just
as bad as missin’ your weekly Saturday bath
in the States.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget my first night in France.
I got put in the jug. Those damn American
M. P.’s of course. Ever since then I ain’t
had much love for that branch of the service.
Course we don’t see too much of them up at
the front, but they get in a man’s way now
and then. Seems as though you had to have
a pass to be on the streets. As usual I
never had any pass, so they grabbed me,
Samson, Johnson, and Kicky Hull. When we
got to the brig we found practically the
whole outfit lined up there.</p>
<p>“We had a fair time the first few days.
But I had a job tryin’ to <i>compree</i> this foolish-looking
French money. Say, O. D., ain’t it
the worst stuff you ever handled? For one
good ten-spot, American dough, I’d give ’em
all the <i>frankers</i> they ever printed. <i>Pas bon</i>,
that stuff.</p>
<p>“I met one fine French family in that
town. There was the mother, father, and girl.
Her name was Suzanne, and, honest, boy, she
was a little rose mademoiselle. Pretty and
delicate-like, you know, and could speak English
in that <i>bon</i> way that these janes
over here <i>parley</i> American after studyin’ it.
Lots better than you or me can. Suzanne
and her people were regular folks. Why, they
were almost the same as Americans. Had all
kinds of stuff in the house, stoves and pianos,
like us, and did mostly as we do, except I
never saw them drinking water.</p>
<p>“Well, Suzanne had a <i>fiancée</i>, a young
French lieutenant, and she was always talkin’
about him and how much she loved him.
She hated the Germans worse than rats. All
Suzanne wanted to do was end the war, have
her <i>fiancé</i> come home and get married. Her
people was pretty wealthy for French people.
Had a big stationery and athletic-goods store.
They sure tried to make life worth while for
old Samson and myself. Believe Sammy was
a bit stuck on Suzanne, but he never said
nothin’ ’bout it to me. He could <i>parley</i> a little
bit, and it used to get me mad as hell to go
into a store or any place and have him start
that French stuff and talk to the people when
I couldn’t get a word of the lingo.</p>
<p>“We must have had a reputation as chambermaids
for mules, ’cause they put the battery
to work in another corral, cleaning it up
and feedin’ the animals. Sometimes they
used to wake us up in the middle of the night
and send us down to ships that had just come
in so that we could lead the mules up to the
corral. That was some job. The mules would
be wilder than ever after bein’ penned up on
a boat so long, and time they’d hit the street
they usually started tearin’ off. If any of us
happened to have hold of them mules at the
time, we mostly went with the mule.</p>
<p>“After a month of that kind of work we
were sent to Camp Coetquidan to learn how
to fight the <i>guerre</i> with real cannon. When
we got to camp the other batteries had already
found out how to fire the guns and
were blowin’ away at anything for a target.
It didn’t take us long to find out how those
six-inch howitzers worked. The French called
’em <i>sonn sankont-sanks</i>, which means one
hundred and fifty-fives.</p>
<p>“I’ll never get in another <i>guerre</i> again as
long as I live, but if I do get mixed up in another
I’ll keep clear of France and especially
Coetquidan. Rain—mud—mud—rain. All
day and all night at that hole. We slept in
the barracks that Napoleon and his army
used to <i>cushay</i> in. No wonder he always had
his hand in his shirt. Guess he was scratchin’.
No, there wasn’t any cooties there. But
they had some kind of bed-ticks or ground
rats that used to bite us up pretty bad. Bein’
about the first fightin’ troops over we couldn’t
expect to have gloves, shower-baths, and
warm barracks. The only thing that was issued
was <i>beaucoup</i> reserve officers.</p>
<p>“I got a pass to be away from camp for
two days and went down to a place called
Rennes, ’bout thirty-eight kilofloppers from
camp. It took six hours to get there on the
little narrow-gauge, and I spent all my time
down there in a big house where I got a <i>bain</i>—that’s
what the Frogs say for bath—tryin’
to get clean. Didn’t get another <i>bain</i> until
two months later at the front.</p>
<p>“Saw a lot of Boche prisoners down there.
Course we seen quite a few at St. Nazaire, but
didn’t have a chance to say anything to ’em.
They must have knew we was green at this
<i>guerre</i> stuff, as they asked us for cigarettes
and chocolate, and we was fools enough to
hand ’em some. Catch me givin’ them dirty
sausage-meats cigarettes now. ‘<i>Caput</i>’ for
’em all, that’s what the Frogs say.</p>
<p>“After Christmas passed and we got our
first real batch of mail—Say, O. D., I guess
you get a bunch of mail from your ma and
sis, don’t you?” asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>“I’ve been getting about four letters a
week, but guess I’ll have to wait until it gets
forwarded to me now,” acknowledged O. D.</p>
<p>“<i>Mon Du!</i>” was the ejaculation, “four a
week. Gosh, you’re lucky. Why, I’ve only
got seventeen since I hit this country.
Course there’s nobody to write me but a few
of the boys down at the newspaper office who
couldn’t pass the physicals——”</p>
<p>“Is that a fact, Jimmy?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui.</i> Bet your tin hat.”</p>
<p>“Don’t see how you stand this life without
letters.”</p>
<p>“Comes tough at times, ’specially when
the other guys gets <i>beaucoup</i> letters. Kinda
feel like a nobody. But generally somethin’
turns up—we start drivin’—or the Boches
get some guts and throw a few over. Then
there ain’t much chance to think about such
things.” Jimmy spoke as if a few letters
could do a great deal toward winning wars.</p>
<p>“By George, I’m goin’ to get Mary to
write to you right—— How do you say it
in French, Jimmy?”</p>
<p>“<i>Toot sweet</i>,” prompted the Yank, with
new hope in his tones.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll have Mary write you <i>toot
sweet</i>, then—that is, if you want me to.”</p>
<p>“Want you to—— Whew, boy, that’ll save
my life. Will you?” he asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>“Sure,” assured O. D.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER V—WE WAS OFF FOR THE FRONT!</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>Before he had joined the army and been
through a lot of front-line stuff Jimmy
McGee thought that it was mighty romantic
to wear a uniform and carry a gun off to war.
But somebody spilled the beans for him pretty
soon. Jimmy couldn’t find any romance in
the mud and rain when his chief ration was
black coffee, canned beef, and hardtack.
When O. D. said that he would have Mary
write to him something stirred ’way down in
him that hadn’t stirred since he had quit
thinking about war as a romantic expedition,
and Jimmy was pretty sure that the romance
stuff was coming back to life again.</p>
<p>“Wonder if Mary would want a souvenir
of this <i>guerre</i>?” asked Jimmy, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“I know she would, because before I left
she made me promise to bring back a German
helmet or something from the battles. But
of course I haven’t been near a fight yet,”
answered O. D.</p>
<p>“Mary gets the helmet that I took from
that Boche major, and <i>toot sweet</i>, you can
bet on that,” declared McGee.</p>
<p>“But you’ll want to keep the helmet yourself,
Jimmy.”</p>
<p>“Hell afire, the helmet’s Mary’s. There’s
no use waitin’ until the <i>guerre</i> is <i>finee</i> before
I give it to her, is there?” blurted out Jimmy,
confusedly.</p>
<p>“No—guess not. Send it to her, then.
Mary’ll be tickled to death with it and to
know that it comes from a real soldier who’s
been wounded. But go on with what you
were tellin’ me. When did you get sent up
to the front?”</p>
<p>“Arrh, we hung ’round Coetquidan until
’bout February first, then we got orders to
<i>partee</i>. We was darn sure that we was goin’
to the front, but didn’t have no idea what
part of it. Anyhow, if you had told us we
wouldn’t have known any better, as we never
paid any particular attention to any special
fronts. All we knew was that the front was
the front.</p>
<p>“Guess you know by now that we don’t
travel first-class in this country. You’ve seen
them little cars that looks like a shoe-box set
on wheels, marked, ‘40 <i>hommes</i>’—that’s forty
like you and me—and ‘8 <i>chevaux</i>’—means
eight horses or as many mules. Well,
that’s the kind of parlor-cars that I’ve been
tourin’ France in. I always get in a horse-car
if I can, as it’s warmer, and, supposin’
the <i>chevaux</i> don’t step all over you, there’s a
chance to lay down and cork off a bit.</p>
<p>“They loaded us bag and baggage on a
train of them kind of cars and a Frog blew
some kind of a horn. We was off for the
front. God a’mighty, you should have heard
them Yanks cheerin’ as we headed for the
front. Passed through a lot of big towns and
<i>beaucoup</i> villages where all of the Frogs came
out to look at us as if we was a travelin’
circus. Come pretty near starvin’ before we
got where we was goin’.</p>
<p>“Stayed on the train all one night and one
whole day. About seven o’clock of the second
night I squirmed into about three feet of floor
space and <i>cushayed</i>. Must have slept pretty
good, ’cause next thing I knew somebody was
shakin’ me and yellin’, ‘Hey, come out of it,
Jimmy—get up, we’re at the front.’ Gee!
I snaps into it and rushes out of the door
expectin’ to see the front right outside. It
was pretty dark, but I looked hard and
couldn’t see no Germans or trenches. It was
quiet as death. I says to Frank Reynolds,
who was top-sergeant of E Battery—you
see, I had transferred from C to E—‘Where
the hell is it?’ ‘What?’ he asks. ‘The front,
you nut,’ I told him. ‘Oh, it’s right around
here,’ and he waved his arms around pointin’
in every direction.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t see nothin’ but a railroad station
and some flat cars. ‘Funniest front I’ve
ever been on,’ said one of them Mexican-border
veterans. ‘This ain’t no front,’ says I.</p>
<p>“’Bout that time it sounded as if there
was goin’ to be a thunder-shower. Everybody
looked at one another kinda funny-like. We
heard the thunder <i>encore</i>. I looked to the
north and there was a lot of flashes showin’
against the sky. The thunder began to growl
like a bunch of bears over a big bone. Some
rockets shot up and spilled a lot of sparks.
A smart guy had to remark that they must
be havin’ a Fourth of July up there, but I was
too busy tryin’ to <i>compree</i> that them things
meant war. I kept sayin’ to myself, ‘That’s
a war goin’ on out there; that’s the thing we
came up here to get in.’</p>
<p>“They talk a lot about thrills in love-stories
and books, but those story-page people don’t
know a thrill from a bowl of mush compared
to the things that was runnin’ up and down
my backbone that first night. Course you
know the guns and flashes was quite a ways,
’bout twenty kilos from where we was, and
there wasn’t much danger of us gettin’ in any
trouble ourselves. But seein’ and hearin’ just
got me to thinkin’ about the old <i>guerre</i> and
knowin’ that we was in it at last—well, it
kind of made me feel a little different, that’s
all.</p>
<p>“We harnessed the old <i>chevaux</i> up, hooked
’em to the guns and got all the other junk,
includin’ them <i>fourgeons</i>—French wagons,
you know—started. ’Bout dawn we rumbled
through a town that looked as if it had been
shut up for the winter. Wasn’t a light goin’.
Not a pup on the streets. Nothin’ but us.
There was <i>beaucoup</i> houses all shot to hell—roofs
gone, windows out, walls cavin’ in.
Some places were nothin’ but rubbish. There
was so little left of a few houses that you
couldn’t have salvaged a thing even if you
had a pull with the guy at the salvage dump.
I found out later that the name of the place
was <i>Swasson</i> (Soissons). Must have been
some battlin’ ’round that joint.</p>
<p>“After leavin’ <i>Swasson</i> we hit a road that
led right up to the trenches, or damn near it,
anyway. Anybody, even an S. O. S. bird
with six months’ experience in Paris, would
have guessed that we must be somewhere near
the front. There was old trenches runnin’
every which way; at that time I thought the
detail that dug ’em must have been zigzag,
as all of the trenches was crooked like a
bunch of old dead snakes. I saw <i>beaucoup</i>
barbed wire stretched ’round. But I’ve seen
lots more since that day.</p>
<p>“As we hiked along a gun would boom out
some place up along the front. Wasn’t none
of that war stuff that you look for after
readin’ some war books. Just now and then
a boom and a flash or two.</p>
<p>“It was mighty cold ridin’ a horse that
night. Bein’ from Florida, I ain’t used to
much cold weather, and my hands and feet
come pretty near bein’ ice before we finally
got to our <i>échelon</i> near a tumbled-down village
called Chassemy. Listen ’bout that
<i>échelon</i> stuff. It was somethin’ new to me
before I got to the front, as I never took
Greek at school. Well, it seems that <i>échelon</i>
means the place that ain’t quite at the front,
but just about as bad, bein’ as how the Boche
can always shell <i>échelons</i> with big guns. The
men, horses, and other things that ain’t
needed at the front all the time stay at the
<i>échelon</i> till they send for them. Time we
made the <i>échelon</i> everybody was so sleepy
that we didn’t wait to unroll, but just
sprawled about on the barrack floor and <i>cushayed</i>.</p>
<p>“I came to about four o’clock in the afternoon
and we started to hunt somethin’ to eat,
naturally. Everybody was damn curious to
know just where the front was. Nobody
seemed to know just exactly what way to take
to get to it and to our positions. You see,
we were to relieve the French. There was
nothin’ else to do but wait ’round.</p>
<p>“Finally, two days later, three French
officers came over and got the Cap to go off
with them to reconnoiter. He came back that
night and told us that we would move the
guns into position next day.</p>
<p>“Next night we took the four pieces and
everythin’ needed to fight the <i>guerre</i> with
and hit for the front. You can imagine us
goin’ to the front for the first time. Lots
of the boys was expectin’ a battle before we
got up there and other guys kept lookin’ for
dead men or wounded. It was the same as
walkin’ to church on Sunday. We got to the
front without knowin’ it.</p>
<p>“‘Here we are,’ says the skipper, and he
halted the column on the side of a road. The
top-sergeant thought he was tryin’ to fool us
and asked him what the halt was for. ‘Do
you want to go out in No Man’s Land?’ asked
the Cap. To tell the truth, it was hard for
any of us to believe that we were at the
front. You’ll find that the front ain’t what
it’s cracked up to be, in a way.</p>
<p>“We put the guns in four positions that
had already been built by the French and
camouflaged ’em with a lot of nettin’. When
I saw ’em in daylight I thought I was lookin’
at a scene in a theater. The gun positions
was right on the road, mind you—any one
passin’ could see ’em, and I thought that we
would hide the things ’way down in some
kind of a mysterious valley, or somethin’
like that.</p>
<p>“Our homes were ’way down under the
earth, dug-outs they call ’em. No chance
much to keep warm in dug-outs, and two men
couldn’t pass each other in ’em, they was so
narrow. We <i>cushayed</i> on wooden planks.
Every thing, kitchens, officers’ quarters, and
all, were down in dug-outs. When you did
get upon the ground you had to be mighty
careful as there was <i>beaucoup</i> shell-holes.
The fields looked as if they had the smallpox—and
it was hard to keep from fallin’ into
them shell-holes.</p>
<p>“After foolin’ around with the old army
stuff of changin’ orders a hundred times a
day we put over our first shots by registerin’
on a brewery that the Germans was supposed
to live in. Before I forget it let me
tell you one of the funniest things about
fronts. Our guns pointed one way and the
front was in another, or almost that bad, anyway.
I kept thinkin’ the lines was out beyond
the muzzles of our pieces, but the Cap said
that it was off to the right more and that if
we walked that way we’d most likely run into
the Germans’ first-line trenches. Sure was a
puzzle to me for a long time.</p>
<p>“Well, can’t say that there was any too
much excitement up on the old Cheman de
Damns front (Chemin des Dames) except the
mornin’ that Jimmy Leach, our cook, made
real biscuits. It’s a wonder the Heinies didn’t
hear us hollerin’ and come over, we made so
much fuss over those biscuits. Then there
was hell to pay after we put over a big barrage
once. You <i>compree</i> barrages, don’t you,
that’s when all the big and little guns start
popping off at once accordin’ to some kind of
a schedule and generally the doughboys go
over under the barrage to attack the Boche
trenches. You see, before we got up there
the Boches and French were fightin’ the
<i>guerre</i> like this, ‘You don’t shoot and I
won’t.’ We changed that argument <i>toot
sweet</i> by startin’ in with barrages and raids.
Naturally the Germans got mad and came
back at us. That made the French hotter
than hell. A general came right over to our
general and said it had to be stopped. No
wonder the <i>guerre</i> ain’t ended. As we was
under the French command we had to do accordin’
to orders.</p>
<p>“You might think that we got into the
ways of the <i>guerre</i> with an awful jolt. But
we didn’t. It just came to us gradual like.
We got used to the whine of a shell and got
so we could tell when they was comin’ and
goin’. There wasn’t many casualties. Few
fellows got bumped off in the infantry on
raidin’ parties. We lost a couple or so in
the artillery.</p>
<p>“I saw my first dead man, killed in the
<i>guerre</i>, about three weeks after goin’ in the
line. Fragments of a shell had hit him in
two or three places. He was messed up all
over one side of the road. I couldn’t tell
much if he was a man or mule, the way he
was scattered ’round. A fellow standin’ near
said it was Bill Rand, a lad I used to sleep
in the same tent with at Boxford. Course I
was sorry for poor Bill, but it didn’t worry
me much. Never thought of it anymore—that’s
the way it’s been for all the boys.
Just got used to takin’ the <i>guerre</i> as it came
along.</p>
<p>“The cooties got on us up there and I
ain’t been lonesome for ’em since that time—don’t
believe a fellow can ever get rid of the
damn things. Gas was the big thing that
scared me at first. Now it’s bombs. O. D.,
one of them Boche planes dronin’ over your
bean, waitin’ to pull up his tailboard and
let a bomb drop, is the worst thing I ever
want to be up against. You ’ain’t got a bit
of protection, unless, of course, you’re ’way
under the ground.</p>
<p>“Talkin’ about the gas stuff reminds me
of what happened to Bill Conway. Bill was
an old regular, been in the service eighteen
years, soldiered every place the American
flag ever flew and told us that gas, bombs,
and shrapnel all tied up in one bag couldn’t
made him budge. We knew Bill pretty well
and if there was anything that had him licked
it was gas. He used to go to sleep with his
mask on sometimes. Well, Jimmy Leach and
a few of us decided to get Bill one night,
so we hid his old gas-mask and when he got
in the dug-out somebody beat on a tin can
and bawled out, ‘Gas—gas!’</p>
<p>“Say, you would have died laughin’ at old
Bill. He jumps for his mask. Nothin’ doin’.
He tried to take Jimmy Leach’s, but couldn’t.
Everybody had piled into the bunks and pulled
blankets over their heads. Some of ’em began
groanin’ and coughin’. ‘Oh, my God,
I’m gassed, I’m gassed!’ yelled Bill, and he
dived under a pile of his own blankets. ‘So
am I,’ shouted Leach, comin’ up for air. The
rest of us all threw the blankets back and
began smokin’. Finally, after ’bout half an
hour, and he nearly suffocated, Bill stuck his
head out and saw us and that there wasn’t
any gas. Maybe he didn’t cuss us out! Said
we were tin soldiers and belonged to a tin
army. Some day if I ever get back to my
old newspaper job and a typewriter I’m goin’
to write a book about Bill Conway and call
it <i>Tin Sojers</i>.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER VI—AMERICAN JOANS OF ARC</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“A month and a half was long enough
for us on the Cheman de Damns front.
We <i>parteed</i> ’bout March fifteenth or so and
got on another one of them funny little
trains—didn’t stay on long—only ’bout fifteen
hours.</p>
<p>“Detrained at Château-Brienne and started
hiking over the road to our rest-camp. We
was due for a rest, also furloughs. But I ain’t
seen neither of them things so far. That
country down there sure was the darb for us.
It was just turnin’ off kind of spring-like and
warm, too. We were the first Americans to
go through that section, and the people—honest,
O. D., they must have thought that we
were American Joans of Arc. Everybody
came rushin’ to the doors and waved to us.
The mademoiselles threw us kisses by the
bushel. I got so excited that I muffed most
of ’em that came my way.</p>
<p>“After bein’ up in that mud-coated front
country where you hardly ever saw human
bein’s, just soldiers, and where all of the
houses had holes in ’em and the gardens were
all torn up by shells, it was great to get back
where the fields was green and people smiled
and said nice things. I was gettin’ to this
French stuff ’bout that time and I could
<i>compree</i> a little of what they said.</p>
<p>“Our first stop was at a little town called
Dienville. We blew in with the band playin’
and everybody happy. The villagers gave us
the hell of a fine welcome and made us feel
to home <i>toot sweet</i>. Right after I put my
horse on the picket-line and camouflaged my
equipment I started lookin’ for something to
monjay and a place to <i>cushay</i>. First store
I hit was a baker shop—<i>boulangerie</i>, they say
in <i>Fransay</i>. The shop was full of women
and little girls. They was talkin’ a mile a
minute. That’s the fastest thing they do in
this country, you know, <i>parley</i>—and every
few minutes I could hear ’em say ‘<i>Américains—Américains</i>.’</p>
<p>“Finally I asked ’bout <i>monjayin’</i> and they
told me where the restaurant was. I never
had tried to get a <i>chambre</i> before, but I got
<i>parleyin’</i> ’bout a place to <i>cushay</i>, and a little
girl ’bout twelve years old and pretty—listen
to me, O. D., that child was the darb of a
<i>petite mademoiselle</i>. She asked her mother
how ’bout my stayin’ with them, or it sounded
that way to me. Course I said in my foolish
French, ‘<i>Keskesay?</i>’ which means, What did
you say?</p>
<p>“The mademoiselle was a little timid.
Guess I’m kind of hard to look at, anyway.
She got closer to her mother, but she didn’t
hide them pretty blue eyes. Looked me
straight in the face and said her mother, the
madame, would fix me up on the <i>cushay</i> stuff.
Then I got kind of brave myself and went
over to her and her mother. The girl put her
hand in mine <i>toot sweet</i> and said, ‘<i>Comrade</i>.’
I never was much for bein’ ’round children,
but I grabbed her and threw her up and
down like I have seen daddies do. She kissed
me smack on the cheek and said her name
was Louise.</p>
<p>“That little mademoiselle’s kiss was the
first one I had in a long time, O. D. Sometimes
I still get the taste of it, as I ’ain’t had
another since. Louise and the madame was
more than <i>jauntee</i>, which as I <i>compree</i> it
means nice, or kind. They fed me <i>dey zerfs</i>,
<i>der lay</i>—that’s eggs and milk—and <i>beaucoup
pom de tear fritz</i> for every <i>monjay</i>. I <i>cu-shayed</i>
in a real <i>lee</i>—Frog for bed—that
night, and honest it took me near three hours
to get asleep, the bed was so soft. Next mornin’
I fooled ’em and didn’t answer <i>reveille</i>—<i>cushayed</i>
till ’bout nine bells and got up,
shaved with real hot water, washed as far
down my neck as my hand could go and sure
felt fittin’ for anything.</p>
<p>“Louise had beat it to school, but the
madame saved a big bowl of <i>café-ooo-lay</i>—O.
D., if you ever drink a bowl of real French
<i>café-ooo-lay</i> you’ll never be satisfied with
that stuff they serve in Childs’ or the Waldorf.
It’s coffee with <i>beaucoup</i> hot milk, and it sure
is the darb. Along with that <i>café-ooo-lay</i> I
had a hunk of regular <i>du pan</i>. Frog bread
is <i>bon</i> when it’s made right—and some <i>du
burre</i>—butter, you know. Madame kept <i>parleyin’</i>
somethin’ ’bout <i>dey zerfs</i>—which are
eggs in American—but I told her that I’d
wait till dinner to <i>monjay</i> the omelet.</p>
<p>“While I was gettin’ away with the <i>petite
dayjunay</i>—as madame called what I was
monjayin’—she told me that her <i>marrieh</i>, her
husband, was a lieutenant in the Frog artillery—<i>swasont
kans</i>—which means the same
as our three-inch pieces. Showed me <i>beaucoup</i>
pictures of the old man and lots of
souvenirs. He’d been in the <i>guerre</i> three and
a half years—wounded three times. I began
thinkin’ that us Americans didn’t have so
much kick comin’ bein’ as how we were about
four years late in gettin’ in against the
Kaiser.</p>
<p>“When Louise came home from school she
took me out for a walk. Say, you ought to
have seen the guys pike me off. ‘What you
doin’, Jimmy, teachin’ kindergarten?’ lots
of ’em asked me. I told ’em no, that she was
my <i>fiancée</i> and was goin’ to <i>partee</i> to
<i>Amérique</i> with me. Louise <i>compreed</i> that
line and said, ‘<i>Oui</i>’ all the time.</p>
<p>“There was a band concert in the little
square that afternoon, and, believe me, the
Frogs sure enjoyed it. They hadn’t heard
any music since the <i>guerre</i> started, except the
church organ, I guess. I had a flock of little
mademoiselles hangin’ on to me by that time,
as Louise was mighty popular with ’em all.
Course, as luck would have it, I had a bar or
two of chocolate in my jeans, and I handed
it over to Louise and her little friends. Boy,
they thought I was a regular Santa Claus
after that.</p>
<p>“When we left Dienville two days later all
the kids in the village was cryin’ because the
Americans was <i>parteein’</i>. I sure got to hand
it to those people in that place, they was the
old darb for us. Course things has changed
a good deal since then—we ain’t new to the
Frogs any more and lots of ’em with stuff to
sell have found out that we get a darn sight
more <i>frankers</i> a month than the Frog army
pays.</p>
<p>“We hiked ’bout five days or so, stoppin’
every night in some village and finally got to
the area which was to be our rest-camp. Just
got settled in the billets when we got an order
to <i>partee toot sweet</i>. We was kinda sore, but
most of us said, ‘<i>Say la guerre</i>,’ and let it go
at that. Nobody knew what the hell it meant
as we was miles from newspapers and telegraph
wires, and never got any news of the
<i>guerre</i>. That’s how we started the seventeen-day
hike from down around Joinville
straight up to the Toul front.</p>
<p>“That hike was one of the worst things
we bucked against durin’ this <i>guerre</i>. There
wasn’t but two days on which the sun came
out at all. It rained day and night. The
roads was all mud and so slippery that the
men and horses was slidin’ all over the place.
There wasn’t no way to carry fresh rations,
so we <i>monjayed</i> ‘corn willy,’ black coffee, and
hardtack seventeen days straight. The horses
had a hell of a time, too, as there never was
enough hay and oats for all of ’em to <i>monjay</i>
at one time. Guess we covered ’bout twenty-two
kilofloppers every day. Never got up
later than three bells in the mornin’ and generally
got to <i>cushay</i> around <i>nerver</i>. That’s
nine o’clock in this country.</p>
<p>“When we hit a town at night we had to
stretch a picket-line for the <i>chevaux</i>, then
water and feed ’em. After that we could
feed ourselves and hunt a <i>chambre</i> or hayloft
to <i>cushay</i>. As a rule, the <i>chambres</i> was
all for the officers when we got to ’em. We
sure had a tough time hikin’ across this damn
country. Never did get warm the whole time.
’Bout that time my old feet began to get
<i>malade</i>. Whenever you hear a Frog say
<i>malade</i> you’ll know they’re talkin’ about bein’
sick. They was so cold all the time until
they would swell up overnight and in the
mornin’ you had a fat chance of gettin’ your
shoes on, as those darn hobnails used to
shrink up like a pair of white-flannel britches
do after washin’ ’em. One mornin’ the old
feet was so bad that I had to wear a pair of
those wooden boats ’round. The doctors call
feet like I had trench feet. I’ve had ’em ever
since. Wear tens now; used to wear eights
and a half back in civilian days.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER VII—THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE GUERRE</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“Long ’bout April second we passed
through Toul and hit the American
front. The First Division outfits was relieved
there by us. Most of our gang got billeted
’round a placed called Boucq. I was at
Corniéville before we went into positions.
Our billets were the worst things a man could
imagine. Dirty, cold, and hardly any bunks
at all.</p>
<p>“We soon found out that we was goin’ to
fight a different kind of <i>guerre</i> down there
than we had been doin’. The country was so
muddy and soft that you couldn’t dig in and
make dug-outs. Everything was on the
ground. Course my battery had to get the
worse place of all—up in a swamp. If you
got off the little duckboard walks you had to
get a detail to pull you out of the mud. The
positions that we had was on the Germans’
maps, as they had already got a gun belonging
to the First Division, before we took the
position over.</p>
<p>“Two days after we got our pieces layed
on some Boche targets they began throwin’
’em over at us. That was the first time we’d
ever been under real shell-fire in the positions.
It was a regular circus. Old Bill Conway
was on gas guard at the time. They gave
us a klaxon for a gas alarm, unless it’s possible
to rig up some kind of a tin gong to
heat on. Well, Bill, he was walkin’ post
swingin’ the Ford klaxon ’round, just as uninterested
in the <i>guerre</i> as if he had been
walkin’ post in a safe Coast Artillery fort.
He had been told to sound that klaxon in
case of gas. A big boy whistled on the way.
Sounds just like the whine of a dyin’ wildcat.
Something terrible to listen to, believe
me, till you get kind of fed up on the stuff.</p>
<p>“Bang—Bluey! That two-twenty—we call
’em barrack bags, they’re so damn big—landed
’bout thirty feet from our last latrine
and sent fragments of itself and trees, with
about a ton of dirt, in all directions. Old
Conway, with his eighteen years of continued
service, started cranking that klaxon for all
he was worth as he ran toward a bunkhouse.</p>
<p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>“The Heinies were puttin’ ’em over for
fair and too damn close to be interestin’.
Course everybody jerked on the old gas-mask.
But Bill Conway was so excited and
scared till he clean forgot all about his own
mask—all he could do was sound that klaxon
and shout, ‘Gas!’ The skipper came tearin’
out of his B. C. station, gas-mask and all.
The first thing he saw was Conway without
a mask. ‘Put your mask on, you boob, ’ain’t
you got any sense? I’ll court martial you for
disregardin’ orders.’ Conway drops the klaxon
and pulls the mask over his bean and
face <i>toot sweet</i>.</p>
<p>“Corporal Reynolds, who was gas non-com.,
comes up about that time and asks Bill
what the devil he sounded the gas alarm for.
Bill says, ‘We’re gettin’ gassed.’ Reynolds,
of course, was expected to know gas from
ordinary fresh air, bein’ as how he was the
gas non-com., so he pulled his mask off and
sniffed ’round considerable. ‘Hell afire,’ says
he, ‘there ain’t no gas.’ Everybody took off
their masks and the skipper gave Conway
extra fatigue for causin’ such a disturbance.</p>
<p>“All durin’ the time that they was arguin’
’bout the gas the old shells were sailing right
over our heads and hittin’ pretty close. One
guy got a splinter in the fat of his thigh and
Deacon O’Tell’s underclothes were ripped off
a line where he had ’em dryin’. But that
was all the casualties we had that day. You
see, the woods was mighty tall and strong
there and they sorta shielded us from the
fragments and hunks.</p>
<p>“Things rattled on that way every day.
We used to get shelled every afternoon ’round
three or four o’clock. Couple of the boys got
it pretty soon and they carted ’em off to a
hospital. Never seen or heard of ’em since.</p>
<p>“The <i>monjayin’</i> was <i>pas bon</i>. Never got
any sugar in the coffee, and as for milk—well,
there wasn’t any ’round them diggin’s.
O. D., that’s one thing that got my goat a
long time. You read ’bout all this Hooverizin’
stuff. How the folks back home is doin’
without sugar—havin’ wheatless, meatless,
fireless and all kind of days so the men at the
front can get the best <i>monjayin’</i> there is—and
we was starvin’ a good many times.
Course if we hadn’t been Americans we’d
have kicked and raised an awful smell, but bein’
a bunch of Yankees and knowin’ what we
was up against in this <i>guerre</i>, we just fooled
’em and kept on regardless. Now I ain’t
sayin’ this so much for myself, cause I’m
pretty hefty and can get along. But we had
a bunch of little guys up there that weren’t
more than a bunch of strings. Those kids used
to stay up all night luggin’ ninety-five-pound
shells—gettin’ wet most of the time—then dive
into their cold bunks, <i>cushay</i> ’bout two hours
and get up to <i>monjay</i>. What the hell do you
think they’d get? Maybe a thin slice or two
of bacon—hardtack most of the time, black
coffee with no sugar, and that’s all. Fat
breakfast for a fightin’ man. You can’t blame
nobody for them things except the people
back at the ports and in the S. O. S. who are
supposed to get the eats up to us.</p>
<p>“That’s a rotten, damn shame, because we
always got good eating back where I was—fresh
meats—vegetables—butter—jam—milk
in the coffee all the time,” interrupted O. D.</p>
<p>“Listen to that,” exploded Jimmy. “There
you are—everybody for himself in this army.
Those ginks back there ain’t worryin’ much
’bout us guys that’s fightin’ this <i>guerre</i>.
‘Send ’em up a carload of “corn-willy” and a
train of hardtack—that’ll be enough to keep
’em goin’ another month or two,’ that’s what
they say down in the S. O. S., I guess.</p>
<p>“Round about April tenth the Boches
thought they’d give our lines a good feel, so
they came over strong and sent gas barrages
and high explosive mixed up with <i>beaucoup</i>
shrapnel and other stuff, along with their
doughboys. This happened up in the Bois
Brûlé—which means burned woods in Frog
lingo. Now you might think that our boys,
bein’ a bit green at the <i>guerre</i> stuff, would
have been sick to their stomachs, or somethin’
like that after gettin’ such rough treatment
from the Boches, but it wasn’t that way at
all. I believe that most of the doughboys was
just itchin’ for a good battle, anyway. The
way they waded into the Boches was big stuff.
Banged ’em all over the lots. When the
ammunition gave out the fellows started wallopin’
’em with their fists and the butt-ends
of rifles. You know Boches ain’t no good
when it comes to fightin’ at close quarters.
In fact, if you take ’em out of that close formation
stuff that they pull when comin’ over—well,
they ain’t worth a hurrah—so when the
Yanks shoved their fists in the snouts it was
<i>finee toot sweet</i>.</p>
<p>“The battlin’ kept up for about three or
four days. Every time the Boches tried to
get a footin’ in Appremont we’d throw ’em
out again. Soon they got tired, seein’ how
impossible it was to stay there, and went
back to their trenches and dug-outs.</p>
<p>“The Boches stayed quiet until the night of
April nineteenth, or rather first thing in the
mornin’ of the twentieth. I was up in a
position so close to the front-line trenches
that you could throw hand grenades at a
Yankee doughboy, if he was fool enough to
stick his bean over the parapet. About ten
men from each battery had been detailed to
man a ninety-five-millimeter battery—some
old-fashioned French guns, relics of the war
in 1870.</p>
<p>“Well, O. D., they can talk ’bout battles
till they’re blue in the face, but I’ll always
claim that the battle of Seicheprey which was
pulled off that mornin’ was the first big
battle of the <i>guerre</i> that this army ever got
mixed up in. We lost five hundred men that
one night and the Boches lost a hell of a lot
more—so you can judge by that.</p>
<p>“Funny as the devil how a man kinda
knows when somethin’ big is comin’ off. But
you do. Every night there’d be <i>beaucoup</i>
rockets and star-shells goin’ up. But this
night there was more than <i>beaucoup</i>, if you
know what that means. The way those red
and different colored rockets began goin’ up
made me think that a bunch of pink, yellow,
and red snakes had been turned loose in
heaven and was crawlin’ ’round the sky. Now
and then a star-shell would go up and bust.
Then you could see the trenches and No Man’s
Land. But that’s all. There wasn’t a thing
stirrin’. Not a sound. Almost too quiet to
be safe.</p>
<p>“Just at the beginnin’ of one o’clock a German
gun boomed. Then hell broke loose all
along our front. Never heard such an infernal
noise in all my life. Sounded like a bunch
of demons poundin’ on brass-drums with trip-hammers.
<i>Toot sweet</i> our guns began to talk
back. They got us up to the pits and we
started to man them crazy-looking ninety-five-millimeter
stove-pipes. That’s what the cannon
looked like, anyway.</p>
<p>“Shells was whizzin’ in from every direction.
High explosive cracked over our beans
and rained down like hail. Rat-ta-tat! Ra-ta-tat!
Bang! Bluey! Smash! That was all
we could hear up and down the lines. The
barrages roared away like barbarian music.
Pretty soon the noise hurt my ears so till I
couldn’t try to listen to orders. Just worked
away like a mechanical man.</p>
<p>“We started to fire just as a shell spilled
its load near the first piece. God! the screech
of them three boys that got all torn up was
enough to tear a man’s ear-drums to shreds—couldn’t
help but hear ’em even with the
bangin’ of the guns.</p>
<p>“All of us was too busy rammin’ shells
in our piece and firin’ the thing to notice much
that was goin’ on, but the flames from the
burstin’ shells and the flares made it almost
as bright as day ever gets to be in this country.
The yellow light was kinda blindin’ as
it came in spurts and jerks. I looked ahead
of us, down toward the trenches and No
Man’s Land. The Boche infantry was coming
straight at us with fixed bayonets. I ain’t
jokin’ you, boy, but there was some kind of a
cold thing chasin’ up and down my old spine
for a few minutes. I could almost see our
doughboys strainin’ down in their trenches
waitin’ to get up and at ’em.</p>
<p>“At last they let ’em go to it. It was
some smash-up when they hit them Germans.
The Boches was at least five to one stronger
than us and their weight counted enough to
make us fall back to the streets of Seicheprey.</p>
<p>“I speak of streets and Seicheprey as if
it might have been a regular village. But
it wasn’t. Seicheprey was just like a village
ghost. Not a house standin’ up—everythin’
littered about. Stones, bricks, wood heaps,
rubbish, barbed-wire entanglements were in
the streets and every place. The fightin’
down there was all hand to hand.</p>
<p>“We had been told to fall back with the
infantry in case it was necessary to let the
Boches come on so that our reinforcements
could get up and give us a hand. But Lieutenant
Davis, who was runnin’ our battery,
was off that fallin’-back stuff. He says,
‘Stick to it, boys, and give ’em hell!’ We
stuck all right, but it was hot stickin’.</p>
<p>“There was one boy only about eighteen
years old in our crew, and when Johnson got
his arm ripped off by shrapnel and it flew off
and hit Jackson, the kid, he got up from the
blow a wild man. That’s one of the worst
things I’ve seen in this <i>guerre</i>.</p>
<p>“Jackson’s face was drippin’ blood and he
was swingin’ Johnson’s arm around to hit the
boys that was tryin’ to get him out of the
pit. It’s damn hard to work with a madman
next to you cursing and prayin’ in the same
breath. Finally they cornered him and carried
him out. Johnson was stone dead, o’
course, and they had to get him out, as we was
steppin’ all over him and trippin’ up. Sergeant
Broadhead and Shorty Williams picked
poor Johnson up and was gettin’ back toward
a dug-out, when high explosive got ’em both—scooped
Broadhead’s stomach right off him
and gashed the legs off of Shorty. Course
we heard ’em groanin’ as the noise of the
battle would go up and down just like a piece
of music. But they quit sufferin’ soon, as
both the lads went west <i>toot sweet</i>.</p>
<p>“All liaison with the other outfits was shot
to hell, and we could only guess at what was
goin’ on with the doughboys and batteries.
From the rifle and machine-gun firin’ and the
shoutin’ and cursin’, too—for there was <i>beaucoup</i>
of that, and it sounded worse than the
barrages, I judged that there must be some
awful battlin’ down in topsy-turvy Seicheprey.
Accordin’ to doughboys that I saw
later, the Boches got mashed up all over that
place.</p>
<p>“You see, when the scrappin’ started down
in Seicheprey it wasn’t in formation. Everybody
was by himself—or almost that way.
That made it rotten for the Boches, as they
ain’t got any guts once they’re alone. So
the doughboys whaled ’em for a bunch of
ghouls. Tell me they stripped right down
from helmets on and started in bare fist or
with bayonets.</p>
<p>“The Boches got some kind of a signal
back to their batteries to throw over gas, and
all of a sudden it looked as if the night had
gone green. Green is the gas warnin’, you
know.</p>
<p>“‘Gas! Gas!’ You could hear that cry
everywhere when the noise of the battle would
let you. We stopped workin’ our piece long
enough to jerk gas-masks on. I swear but
we looked like a bunch of devils with them
things on, ’specially when the flames would
shoot up around us.</p>
<p>“Our gang was gettin’ it pretty hot ’round
the gun-pits and there was so many of the
fellows wounded and lyin’ out beyond the pits
that the Sanitary guys couldn’t drag ’em in
fast enough. Most of these wounded had
been on the ammunition details and were hit
on the way to the guns with shells. Every
forty-five minutes a few of us would get relieved
and crawl into the dug-out for a minute’s
rest. The Sanitary men asked for volunteers
to help ’em get the wounded in.
Every man who was on relief at that minute
jumped up and went out to bring the boys in.
That’s the kind of spirit they had.</p>
<p>“A chap by the name of Wilson from
F Battery had gone out to bring in some
other lad and he got both of his own legs
blown off. My old pal, Frank Gordon, heard
Wilson moanin’ out there and he ran out
to get him.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget what happened just as
Frank got on top of the little trench that
ran ’round our gun. He had Wilson’s legless
body slung over his back. Shrapnel
screamed like a hell-cat and good old Gordon’s
left arm and part of his head were
jerked right out of socket and went flyin’
over our heads. Gordon and Wilson toppled
out of sight. I saw it all and couldn’t stop
myself. I jumped the trench, grabbed the
first moanin’ body I come to. Couldn’t see
’em as there wasn’t so much flares goin’, and
ran for the dug-out that they was usin’ as
a first-aid station. I found out that I had
brought Ray Mason in.”</p>

<div class='c'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER VIII—“GUESS I DIDN’T HAVE THE GUTS”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“That dug-out was sure one hell-hole.
See we had been gettin’ gas right
along and it poured in the dug-out, as they
had to keep openin’ the door to let ’em in
with wounded. There was nine fellows,
naked and smeared all up with iodine and
blood, stretched out on bunks. Most of ’em
were so torn up and badly hurt that their
wounds had made ’em numb. Consequently
they were darn quiet—except one little Greek
boy. He was alive to pain all right. Both
his eyes were hangin’ to strings of flesh and
his body was like an old flour-sieve. He
couldn’t keep from moanin’, and I’ll be
damned if I could keep from listenin’ to him.</p>
<p>“The first thing a wounded man generally
does is to jerk his mask off, if he’s got one
on. That’s what the boys were doin’ in the
dug-out. You had to battle with some of ’em
to keep the things on. Those that did get
the masks off got sick and vomited all over.
Gosh, O. D., it was kinda bad down there.
The big thing that appealed to me was how
all the guys acted. Those that wasn’t
wounded worked along pretty cool and didn’t
show much signs of breakin’. The wounded
showed a lot of guts the way they kept still
and didn’t let the old hurts get the best
of ’em.</p>
<p>“While I was down there givin’ ’em a
hand a doughboy that had been captured
crawled into the dug-out with his tongue cut
out. The Boches did that to scare us, and
they drove him back into our lines with a
bayonet. Hines, one of the gun crew, went
crazy, he got so mad when he heard that, and
tore out of the place for Seicheprey, where
he got fightin’ hand to hand with the Germans.</p>
<p>“I went back to the gun and was fixin’ to
try and get Frank when Lieutenant Davis
gave us orders to fire again, and said there
was no use tryin’ to bring him in, as he was
dead.</p>
<p>“The ammunition was comin’ mighty slow
and when a man came in with a shell I told
him to make it snappy and get ’em comin’
faster. He said, ‘All right, Jimmy.’ I looked
at him hard, and be damned if it wasn’t
Father Farrell, our chaplain. Say, that was
one brave little guy. He ain’t any bigger
than a small kid, but he was luggin’ shells for
a long time before he let anybody know it
was him.</p>
<p>“Course, every time one o’ the boys would
get it he would run to him <i>toot sweet</i> and do
what he could—brought the wounded in and
buried the dead right under the hardest kind
of a fire. Father Farrell got nicked in the
arm with a shell splinter on his way back to
the rear the next day. So did I. On recommendation
of our general the French gave
him a <i>Craw de Guerre</i>. I never could say
that thing right, but it’s a War Cross for
pullin’ hero stuff.</p>
<p>“I saw how hard the chaplain was workin’
and I knew my job on the crew wasn’t so
heavy, so he took my place and I carted ammunition
a while. Just when we thought that
the thing was <i>fineed</i> a Boche plane came
swoopin’ down on us and opened up a
machine-gun barrage. I’ll say that the Boches
had pretty good guts, but no more than Carl
Davis had, the ‘loot’ that was our C. O.
Davis grabbed a rifle from one of the gang
and ran right after that Boche, pepperin’
away at him like he was shootin’ at a flock of
blackbirds. It was still darker than hell and
all that we could see of the Boche plane
was black outlines, just as if some big hawk
was flappin’ its wings right over our heads.
Gee! it was uncanny and sort of ghostlike.
Davis was runnin’ up and down like a man
in a relay race all by himself. He didn’t
have nothin’ on except an undershirt, pants,
and boots. We all laughed at him and that
helped a lot to get our minds off our troubles.
Finally the Boche whirred away and
Lieutenant Davis put the old rifle up. Poor
Davis, he was some fightin’ kid. They got
him up at Château-Thierry. But that comes
later.</p>
<p>“The battlin’ was wearin’ down to a
small noise. Most of the Boches had all
they could stand. They began tryin’ to get
back to their lines, and our batteries cut
’em up like a lawn-mower gets the grass.
Their artillery had shut up except those few
guns that was firin’ at ambulances and
wounded parties. You see, our ambulances
had to come up over a road that was pickin’
and when they started ’round Dead Man’s
Curve—Bluey! Bang!—the Boches would
smash ’em, wounded and all, into pieces. We
had to keep our wounded down in that dugout
about six hours waitin’ to evacuate ’em
on that account. The little Greek boy I was
tellin’ you about died before they got him
away.</p>
<p>“Exceptin’ for a few guns goin’, now and
then, the place was quiet ’round five-thirty.
So quiet you could hear the wounded moanin’
mighty easy, and now and then a thud was
heard when barbed wire supportin’ a dead
man would snap and let the body hit the
ground.</p>
<p>“The early mornin’ was as gray as cigarette
ashes, but it was plenty light enough
to see what was ’round us. I wished it had
been a blame sight darker. I couldn’t look at
poor old Frank Gordon to save my life. He
was lyin’ right outside the trench—face turned
toward the dug-out, mouth wide open and all
blue and bloated like. The only arm he had
was pointin’ to the sky just like an arrow.
He was almost straddlin’ Wilson’s trunk.</p>
<p>“But Gordon and Wilson was just two of
many. There was <i>beaucoup</i> more of our boys
and officers lyin’ ’round in stiff heaps, all
broken and twisted up. Down ’round the first-line
infantry trenches it was as grim lookin’
as an opened-up graveyard. There was <i>beaucoup</i>
Germans piled up on the ground and
hangin’ on wire entanglements. All mostly
dead—some just dyin’. I saw a few Americans
scattered in and out between ’em, too.</p>
<p>“Father Farrell came along and asked some
of us to give him a hand to put the boys
away. I was one of the gang that started the
buryin’ stuff, but when I came to Frank Gordon—
Honest to God, O. D., I couldn’t touch
him. Sounds foolish to say that—don’t it?
I swear it’s a fact. Guess I didn’t have the
guts.</p>
<p>“I says, ‘Father, you’ll have to get somebody
else on this detail in my place. I can’t
touch Gordon.’ I used to sleep with that
boy and listen to him tell me ’bout his girl,
a colleen that was waitin’ for him to come
back to the old country—Gordon was born in
Ireland, you see. Father Farrell understood,
I guess, ’cause he says, ‘Here, you take his
identification tag, this ring and pocketbook,
and keep it; they’re his effects. Then you
beat it to the dug-out.’ I grabbed them things
and run like hell. I was kinda feelin’ funny
in the gills. First and last time it’s hit me
that way, though.</p>
<p>“We got relieved that night and were sent
back to the <i>échelon</i> for a rest and somethin’
to eat. We’d been <i>monjayin’</i> the old iron
rations for almost a week straight.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t have been nothin’ more than
half natural for us to mope ’round after
such excitement and think ’bout it or talk a
hell of a lot. But I never saw much of that
stuff—not durin’ the whole time we’ve been
in the <i>guerre</i>. Day after we got back we got
an old madame to cook up a big feed for some
of us that was on the gun crew. Had a hot
bath before <i>monjayin’</i>, and maybe I didn’t feel
like a regular guy!</p>
<p>“All the fellows was cleaned up, and you’d
have never known that they had been battlin’.
Course everybody missed old Gordon. He
could tell the funniest stories I ever listened
to and play and sing stuff in a way that
would have set Broadway nuts. Somebody
got up and said a toast to him, and we drank
champagne to his memory. There wasn’t no
crape-hangers at the party. Course we was
mighty sorry for the boys that had passed
out. But we still had to fight the <i>guerre</i> for
ourselves, and if there’s any way the
<i>guerre</i> can lick you it’s by getting your goat
over things that’s happened to you or your
pals. You got to forget it, O. D. Got to be
a hard guy as much as you can.</p>
<p>“I heard lots about the stuff called philosophy
of soldiers and all that bosh before I got
over here—if it’s philosophy that they’ve got
or actin’, I don’t believe the boys know it
themselves. Anyhow they call it that in books
and magazines. I used to throw that kind of
line back yonder, years ago—so it seems. But
I’m <i>finée</i> now. You got to hand me nails
when I ask for nails to-day. Brass-headed
tacks won’t do, O. D.</p>
<p>“But to get back to the philosophy stuff.
In this <i>guerre</i> you got to tell yourself that
there ain’t no shells or bullets with your
name on ’em, watch your step on the gas stuff
and you ain’t got much to say about whether
a bomb is goin’ to get you or not. So quit
worryin’ ’bout ’em till you get in a raid.
Makes no difference how close they come or
how many they get right next to you. That’s
just proof that nothin’ ain’t labeled for you.
Get me on that? All right, next. One of
the first damn things in French I’m goin’ to
learn you is to say, ‘<i>Say la guerre.</i>’ Means,
‘It’s the war.’ When you get to sayin’ that
till you believe it then you got the old war
licked a hundred ways. That’s my way of
lookin’ at this stuff. Call it philosophy if
you want to. But old Zeke Doolittle looks at
it the same way and he couldn’t know a philosophy

the doctor next day. Had a bellyache that

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER IX—“THE OLD VAN SEEZEUM ON ITS WAY”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“After the scrap ’round Seicheprey we
didn’t <i>encore</i> the battle much except
when the Battle of Boucq started. That was
one hell of a curious battle. The Boches got
mad and began heavin’ shells ’way back in
the rears. Boucq wasn’t too far away to be
in it.</p>
<p>“That’s where all our headquarters was
located—regimental, brigade, division, and the
whole damn shootin’-match. At that time
Mudgy Jones, also known as Chisel-Face or
Whistlin’ Jaws, was colonel of our regiment.
Let me tell you right now our regiment had a
hell of a time gettin’ where it was, handicapped
as we were with that man as a C. O.
All he could do was walk ’round whistlin’
somethin’ that didn’t have no tune at all and
find fault. Well, just to show you what kind
of a gink Mudgy was, when the stuff started
comin’ and breakin’ near regimental P. C. he
dives down into a cellar and loses himself.
The general comes over to give him hell ’bout
somethin’, and he couldn’t be found. Finally
some guy bribed Jones’ orderly to tell where
he was. Mudgy didn’t pull any whistle stuff
when the old gen. hauled him up.</p>
<p>“The battle of Boucq lasted ’bout four
days, durin’ which the One Hundred and
Fourth Infantry—hardest bunch of doughboys
in this man’s army—got lined up on a hill
by some French general and handed the Craw
de Guerre for the whole damn outfit. Only
outfit in the A. E. F. that can wear that thing
as a regiment, too.</p>
<p>“We had a gang fight down ’round Xivray
that lasted a day or so and made us lose quite
a number of the fellows. Then we got pulled
out of the Toul lines and loaded on another
bunch of foolish-lookin’ trains. When we
was loadin’—that was ’bout the last day of
June or nearbouts—they handed out some
wild rumor stuff ’bout us goin’ to parade
in Paree on the Fourth. All the <i>soldats</i>
believed it and a hell of a lot of second looeys—even
the C. O. By the way, Davis that
was with us at Seicheprey had been made a
captain and put in charge of our outfit.</p>
<p>“The train started toward Paree and made
’bout three hundred kilos in that direction.
All along the tracks and in the big towns
we passed through there was gangs of girls
and school-kids shoutin’ at us. Throwin’
kisses and askin’ for <i>bisqués</i>—them’s biscuits
in <i>anglay</i>. We fired all the hardtack we had
to ’em, as usual.</p>
<p>“That was the time we learned how to call
ourselves in <i>fransay</i>. I kept hearin’ the
French kids sayin’ somethin’ that sounded like
‘<i>Van Seezeum</i>’ and wondered what the hell it
meant. A French Canuck up and says,
‘That’s the way they say Twenty-sixth in
Frog.’ They was glad, he says, because the
old <i>Van Seezeum</i> was on its way. Then I
began gettin’ it. The kids knew who we was
somehow. Some of ’em hollered, ‘<i>Caput</i>
Boches at Seicheprey.’ Gosh! there must have
been somethin’ in the papers ’bout us, the
way they was talkin’ it off.</p>
<p>“Right when we got close enough to smell
Paree—and Otto Page began swearin’ that
he could see the Eiffel Tower—the trains got
switched off to the right and started hell bent
for election toward Château-Thierry. Noisy-le-Sec
was where we got switched off, and
that’s where the cussin’ started and it lasted
until we got in the old <i>guerre</i> again up ’round
Saacy and Citry.</p>
<p>“Damn, but we was sore—been thinkin’
’bout that promised rest and paradin’ up and
down Paree, you know, and we felt that they
was rubbin’ it in, that’s all. They just hated
to think that some guy was rubbin’ it in. We
was National Guard Boy Scouts, some of ’em
called us before the <i>guerre</i>. But they can
take their funny names plumb to hell to-day.
Like to know where this man’s army would
be if it wasn’t for the National Guard.</p>
<p>“Jerked us out of sleep ’bout midnight and
unloaded the works at a joint called La
Ferté—hiked thirteen kilofloppers to a town
that I couldn’t call out loud if I wanted to.
Have to think it when I want to remember
anythin’ ’bout the place. They put us up
in a big park. Spent the Fourth there. The
villagers hung out <i>beaucoup</i> flags, but I
couldn’t recognize ’em, though a Frenchman
pointed to some and said, ‘<i>Américain</i>.’ Had a
party on the Fourth. <i>Beaucoup van rouge.</i>
Some old champagne—and a <i>poulet</i>. Forgot
to tell you ’bout <i>poulets</i>—they’re chickens—the
eatin’ kind, you <i>savvy</i>?</p>
<p>“Next day we got orders to haul it up to
the front or pretty near it. We blew into a
big <i>château</i> grounds ’round early mornin’—everybody
was so darn tired they <i>cushayed</i>
right off the bat without camouflaging the
stuff. A nuisance by name of Boots Jenkins,
who had been made a second looey
when even corporals was hard to get, was
the Officer of the Day. He didn’t come to
until broad daylight and a bunch of Boche
planes got hummin’ overhead. Boots tried to
turn out the guard—and found out that he
had forgot to put a guard on at all. ‘Some
guy he was.’ Then he started wakin’ everybody
up. ‘Get up, every mother’s son of
you, move this picket-line and camouflage the
wagons. Come on, shake it up,’ and he pulled
the blankets off George Woods. ‘Git the hell
out o’ here—I’m <i>cushayin’</i>,’ bawled Woods.
‘Don’t give a damn, get up,’ commanded Jenkins.
‘Ah, take a flop for yourself, I don’t
belong to your gang. I’m a naval gunner
on special duty.’ That’s what Boots got on
every side.</p>
<p>“After a long time he got the stable sergeant—some
draggin’ kitchen police and old
Bill Conway—wonderful crew for a detail.
They moved every damn <i>cheval</i> we had and
threw bushes over the guns and wagons. The
rest of us had dragged our blankets and stuff
up to the top of a hill and <i>cushayed</i> right on.</p>
<p>“The outfits hid in that big woods until it
got time for us to cross the Marne and relieve
the Second Division. This happened ’bout
July eleventh or so. We was all set for any
trick that the Boches might be willin’ to try.</p>
<p>“There had been <i>beaucoup</i> bull flyin’ ’round
that Germany was makin’ a last big drive for
old Paree and most likely they’d try to cut
through us ’round the Château-Thierry sector—that
stuff was pretty well soaked into us
and guess the gang wanted to show the
marines that two weeks in Belleau Woods
wasn’t such big stuff after all, considerin’ the
way they jumped into the battlin’ when it
started. Course I ain’t disputin’ that the
marines didn’t pull off good stunts down
there. But you got to remember we’d been in
the lines damn near six months when the noise
started at Château-Thierry.”</p>

<div class='c'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER X—CHÂTEAU-THIERRY</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“July fifteenth started off with a good
bang.</p>
<p>“The Boches began drivin’ from Rheims to
where we were. The good old Rainbow boys
from the Forty-second Division was near
Rheims, so we didn’t worry much ’bout the
Boches breakin’ through on the right flank.
When the drive started toward us through
Château-Thierry the Boches laid their last
egg, I’m thinking. They gained a few yards
the first day. Slowed right up the second.
On the third we stopped ’em dead still in their
tracks.</p>
<p>“The big thing happened before we had
time to know it was comin’ off. Some bird—Foch
most likely—pushed a button and the
whole damn French and American lines
jumped up and busted the Boches right on the
nose and in the eyes.</p>
<p>“Say, O. D., we better <i>cushay</i> before I get
talkin’ ’bout them mad days from Torcy up
to Sergy Plateau. I could keep you awake
all night listenin’ to that Château-Thierry
stuff,” said Jimmy. His blue eyes were
shooting fire and his face showed the excitement
that just the mention of Château-Thierry
caused.</p>
<p>“If you stop now, Jimmy, I won’t ask Mary
to write to you,” warned O. D.</p>
<p>“You win, <i>toot sweet</i>,” answered McGee,
quickly.</p>
<p>“<i>Encore</i>, then. If that’s the way you say
it in French,” begged the brother of Mary.</p>
<p>“My outfit was stuck up on the top of a
little ant-hill with the old howitzers pointed
slam-bang at the Germans who was on a
small mountain right across the way, when
our drive got under way. The Yankee
doughboys was down on the side of the ant-hill,
hangin’ on the roots and different kind of
bushes to keep from slidin’ down to the bottom
and boggin’ up to their necks in mud.
The Boches had all the high places.</p>
<p>“The doughboys started over. We had to
grab a place called Torcy. Now you must
remember that country had seen <i>beaucoup</i>
battlin’ and was all shot up—so much so it
was mighty hard traveling. There was so
much rubbish and ruins. All that was left
of some towns was names. As I said, the
infantry jumped at ’em. The Boches was
sure caught nappin’—didn’t have an idea that
we would come back so quick and hard. <i>Toot
sweet</i> they began givin’ us hell with their
damn machine-guns. Course that was while
they was makin’ a stab at gettin’ their yellow
doughboys over the big scare that we threw
into ’em. But our boys had got such a start
that machine-gun fire, even as hellish as what
they pumped into us, couldn’t stop ’em. They
was out for the Kaiser’s scalp.</p>
<p>“We took Torcy on the short end of
bayonets and barrage. The old artillery
banged the Boches into a lot of sausage meat.
The bodies used to trip us up, and how some
of the guys cussed them dead Germans. <i>Toot
sweet</i> after we started the drive a drove of
prisoners began comin’ in—privates, non-coms.,
loots, majors, and even colonels. We
called ’em all Heinie and Fritz, you know,
and some of the Boche officers got mad as
the devil and wanted to be treated as officers.
The Yanks prodded ’em with stiff bayonets
when they pulled that stuff.</p>
<p>“From the first minute of the drive there
was no let-up in battlin’. None of that trench-line
fightin’. Open warfare, buddy. Open as
a doorless barn, I mean. The noise never
stopped like it did at Seicheprey, a few hours
after it started. No, O. D., it was just one
continual roarin’, bangin’, crashin’, swearin’,
moanin’, and prayin’.   That’s all. Gosh!
there was so many kinds of different things
that could kill a man, goin’ at the same time
that it’s a wonder anybody was left to tell
’bout the Second Battle of the Marne.</p>
<p>“Time we took Torcy they said to get Hill
190. Maybe you know that’s right ’bove
Château-Thierry itself. You can imagine
that the Boches made some stand to hang on
to that place. They sure did. We had <i>beaucoup</i>
boys put out of business gettin’ up to
Hill 190, believe me.</p>
<p>“After strugglin’ up the sides of the hill—through
barbed wire almost five feet high—and
gettin’ a smashin’ artillery barrage shot
at us—the Boches had got their big guns back
and in position by that time—we ran into
the worst machine-gun fire that ever was. The
dirty Germans had camouflaged a few hundred
machine-guns in a big wheat-field on top
of the hill. You couldn’t see nothin’ but the
wheat wavin’ in the breeze when we started
across it.</p>
<p>“Rat-ta-ta-tat! went the machine-guns. The
boys began droppin’ like rain. Wiped out
companies at times. Our own machine-gunners
said, ‘To hell with waitin’ on horses and
mules.’ They dragged their little babies right
up to that wheat-field and gave the Boches
some of their own medicine. Will you believe
me that lots of the Boche gunners was found
chained to their guns? Yep. It’s a fact. The
Boche morale had got so low till they had to
chain their men to posts.</p>
<p>“The old <i>cheveaux</i> that used to drag our
pieces ’round was half dead, anyway, when
the drivin’ started, and we had one hell of a
time tryin’ to keep up with the doughboys.
Everybody had to get on the wheels and push
and cuss at the same time. I tell you, man,
the damn <i>chevaux</i> was dyin’ in the traces.
We managed to keep within range, but had to
get some trucks to help us move.</p>
<p>“The Boches was thrown so hard from the
top of Hill 190 that you could hear their necks
breakin’ when they landed down in the valley.
I never saw such a gory-looking hill in all
the days of drivin’. There was men piled
waist high. Mostly Germans. Nobody had
time to stop and bury dead people at a time
like that. There wasn’t time for nothin’ but
fightin’ and movin’.</p>
<p>“Takin’ 190 meant gettin’ into Château-Thierry.
We found <i>beaucoup</i> Boches down
there. They put up a scrap because there was
a pile of stuff in the town that they wanted
to try and save. Down in some parts of the
joint, even after most of the Germans had
started sprintin’ for the Fatherland, there was
some terrible battlin’.</p>
<p>“The main <i>rues</i> and <i>boulevards</i> was all
chock-ablock with breastworks. They had
pianos, tables, beds, big lookin’-glasses, sofas,
bags stuffed with rotten smellin’ rags and
rubbish, piled up—well, Lord knows what
wasn’t used to stop us. Behind these things
was the Boche machine-guns. They was just
like a bunch of hose and played as wicked a
stream of lead as you can think of. Americans
and Frogs both forced these works and
<i>fineed</i> the machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>“After that there ain’t no way to describe
the fightin’. It got all over the place. Like
scrambled eggs in a fryin’-pan. The Yanks
used rifles for clubs and waded into the Boches
like a bunch of good cops. Bayonets and
trench dirks came in with a noise like <i>finee</i> for
the Germans—chased ’em up alleyways, dug
’em out of cellars, laid ’em cold—that’s all
there was to it.</p>
<p>“Long, black shadows were camouflagin’
what was left of Château-Thierry as we rumbled
through it. I ain’t much at tellin’ how
things look, any more. But Château-Thierry
looked like a plowed-up graveyard and then
some. The moonlight got turned on and made
everythin’ seem ten times worse, as the effect
was kinda weird. Houses looked like a bunch
of crumblin’ skeletons. Troops was movin’
over every street. Supply-trains and ammunition
trucks rattled up and down. Ambulances
crawled by so slow till we could hear
the groans of the poor guys in them.</p>
<p>“Time we got opposite the bridge that had
been knocked into the river by American artillery
we got treated to a warm bombardment.
Mashed up some of the lads pretty badly.
That bombardment wasn’t a trifle compared
to the smell that came from unburied men.
Whew! I hadn’t got a chance to <i>monjay</i> all
day and my belly was pretty weak ’bout that
time. It sure was an awful stink.</p>
<p>“There was dead Americans, dead Frenchmen,
and heaps of stark Boche corpses linin’
the route—just like so many yard stones.
Couldn’t help but feel good when we would
pass a big bunch of them swollen-up Germans,
all blue in the face from dyin’ like they did.</p>
<p>“Our column was halted in Château-Thierry
for ’bout three hours. We had to
wait for some trucks to <i>encore</i> the drive with.
Poor old <i>chevaux</i> were down for the count.</p>
<p>“I had already lost <i>beaucoup</i> stuff. Thought
I’d hunt ’round some of the near-by houses,
or what was left of houses. Needed some
underclothes pretty bad. In one place I found
a closet full of mademoiselle’s underclothes.
You know that kind of stuff all full of holes
and ribbons. I was up against it for underwear.
As it was, I didn’t have on any drawers.
I grabbed two suits and gave two to
George Neil. Damn stuff nearly choked me
to death after I got it on. The girl who wore
it was smaller than me in a good many places.
Four days after I got the stuff Neil and I
hit a little stream and thought we’d try to
take a bath. Funny as a crutch, the way
we looked gettin’ out o’ the mademoiselle’s
riggin’s. Neil got one arm caught in some
lace and got a cramp before he could get
loose again.</p>
<p>“Just before daybreak we got orders to
move ahead. Most of the hikin’ was right
down alongside the Marne—river looked like
a big red, open sewer. Never hope to see so
much filthy water in my life again. Bodies,
wreckage of all kinds, clothes, empty ammunition
cases. A hundred things else, I guess.
All floatin’ down the stream. The tide washed
lots of bodies to shore. Most of them you
couldn’t recognize, as the water and fishes
had eaten their faces and hands off. Only
way we could tell what army they belonged to
was by parts of equipment and uniforms.
Water had faded most of the uniforms,
though.</p>
<p>“The woods and river sent up an awful
smell. When we came to a windin’ road that
looked like a brown snake crawlin’ up a hill
the column turned up it and pretty soon we
was in position with the old pieces boomin’
away at the flyin’ Boches.</p>
<p>“Boche prisoners was pourin’ in like smoke
pours out of a factory smoke-stack. Some
of ’em tried to be friendly. There was damn
few smiles they got from us, I can tell you.
We were darn tired of their ways of yellin’
‘<i>Kamerad!</i>’ and then throwin’ them hand
grenades at a man.</p>
<p>“The boys was all full o’ fun at that. Most
of ’em had got hold of high hats, derbies,
colored parasols, and a lot of other fool
things in Château-Thierry, and the next
mornin’ they was drivin’ along wearin’ silk
hats, carryin’ green umbrellas and Lord
knows what else. I had a high hat on myself.
The Frenchmen thought we was nuts sure
enough, goin’ to war rigged up like that. But
we told ’em ‘<i>Say la guerre.</i>’ O. D., the guys
in this man’s army ain’t lettin’ no <i>guerre</i> get
their nannies. I guess most of ’em was
brought up just to get in this <i>guerre</i> and wallop
the Heinies.</p>
<p>“’Bout twelve bells we started firin’. Just
in time to let dinner get cold. Hadn’t put
over eight rounds before the old coal barges—that’s
the big shells that Fritz throws at us—began
sailin’ right in. Third shell struck a
shallow dug-out ’bout twenty feet from where
our piece was. There was four boys tryin’ to
<i>cushay</i> in that dug-out. They was all in a
row, accordin’ to the way I heard it. First
one nearest us got smashed up ’round the
lungs. Olsmo, second lad, got killed outright.
He was mashed to pulp in places.
Ripped the stomach out of Papan, next to
him, and tore Pap’s knees clean out of socket.
The fourth guy, Thayer, sleepin’ jam up to
Pap, didn’t get a scratch—not a thing. Course
he got all bloody from the others. But that
wasn’t nothin’.</p>
<p>“When we dug ’em out we found Silvia,
the first lad, dyin’. He <i>fineed toot sweet</i>. Just
a gasp or so ended him. Olsmo, of course,
was stone cold—gashed into tit-bits from head
to foot. O. D., he was twisted inside out and
then all ground up like hash. Them shells
can sure ruin a man. Poor Pap, he got it
worse than all. ’Cause it didn’t kill him. His
legs dangled from threads of flesh. You
couldn’t see his face on account of the blood
that spurted from his chest—covered his face
with red. Pap was in some agony, boy, but
he had guts. Looked like his pain gave him
strength. But guess it was the madness that
made him act strong and not the hurtin’. He
went insane for a few minutes—then he would
quiet down.</p>
<p>“‘Olsmo,’ he shouted, grittin’ his teeth
so till it gave me cold shivers. Then he shook
cold Olsmo with his blood-drippin’ hand.
‘Snap into it,’ yelled Pap. ‘Christ Almighty,
man, we can’t stay here. It’s killin’ me.
Move! Get that horse out of my way. Cannoneers
on the wheels.’ He raved until he
got so weak he just couldn’t whisper. The
way Pap stared at us out of them sunken
eyes of his was enough to scare a man to
death. But when your pals are dyin’, sufferin’,
cussin’, prayin’, beggin’ for water and
cigarettes, a man ain’t got no business to be
scared, O. D. That’s what kept lots of us
goin’, I suppose. Pap wanted cigarettes. Had
to smoke, he said. Course we gave ’em to him.
But as fast as he got one in his mouth he’d
throw it away and holler for another.</p>
<p>“The shellin’ was goin’ on merrily durin’
all that time. Our piece was out of action, of
course, till we got Pap in the ambulance.
Heard later that he didn’t pass out for ten
hours. Docs claim he was the grittiest man
they’d seen in some time. Wasn’t time to
bury the other lads then. We wrapped ’em in
shelter-halves, dug holes and put ’em all in
the same grave that night before we pulled to
another place.</p>
<p>“We got orders to move three kilos that
night and go in another position. Hitched and
hooked in ’round five. That gave us time
enough to down some ‘corn-willy’ and black
coffee. First we’d had to <i>monjay</i> since
mornin’. Soon as it was dark we got out on
the main road and started. That road was
just like Broadway with traffic. Only they
don’t have so many ambulances goin’ up and
down Broadway. It was all a man could do
to skin himself and horse, or whatever his
<i>cheval</i> was hooked on to, by the stuff that
was floodin’ down from the first lines. There
wasn’t no trenches in that war. Just lines,
and half the time we didn’t know just where
in hell the first lines was, ’cause after them
doughboys would make three or four kilometers
they would be scattered all over creation.</p>
<p>“Column halted near a little village that
was all knocked into a cocked hat. There was
a few thousand replacements waitin’ to go
in. All infantry. On one side of the road
was a battery of 155 longs. Them things
make a noise like a mine explosion and raise
a man off his feet when they go off. The
horses got scared, naturally, and part of the
column got smeared all over the road.</p>
<p>“Just ’bout that time General Edwards
comes bowlin’ along in his big limousine. He
was ridin’ on the seat with the driver. The
back of the machine was full of sandwiches.
Course he couldn’t get by on account of the
jam-up. Boy, he climbed down and got hold
of a first loot who was in the command of
the outfit whose horses was raisin’ all the
hell. Gosh! you ought to heard him give that
gink a bawlin’-out.</p>
<p>“‘Git this stuff out of my way! Damn
quick too! Look in that car. Look!’ he
yelled; honest he was cryin’. ‘See what’s
there, don’t you? Somethin’ to eat for my
boys. Yes, the doughboys. Now move.’ O. D.
that first loot got on a caisson wheel and
strained himself enough to get a discharge
from the army. They got the stuff out of
the way <i>toot sweet</i>.</p>
<p>“General Edwards hadn’t no more than got
started when the old shells, whizz-bangs, blew
in town with an awful noise. Gas came over,
too. There was gas alarms goin’ enough to
wake New York City out of a Sunday-mornin’
sleep. Then those cussed Boche planes began
dronin’ over our heads. Ever heard a bomb
explode? No? Well, you’re just as well off.
They’re <i>pas bon</i> stuff, O. D.</p>
<p>“The Boches sure must have known that we
was right down-stairs under ’em, ’cause they
started pullin’ up the old tailboards and droppin’
’em every damn minute. Bombs, bombs,
and more bombs. They dropped right in the
column, knocked ruined houses into our ears,
filled your eyes with dirt. Some horses, ’bout
ten, got hurt so bad we had to shoot ’em.
Think ’bout three men got killed while the
jam lasted, but ain’t quite sure.</p>
<p>“We moved after a while, and the planes
followed us up. Got to the fork of some roads
and took the one leadin’ right down to the
Marne. That was just below Mont St. Pierre,
a little village. There was a pontoon bridge,
one of them boat things, you know—right near
where we halted for the night. You can
imagine how the Germans was tryin’ to pot-shot
that bridge. The town was all marbles
from shells hittin’ it that was aimed at the
bridge.</p>
<p>“Time we halted a big boy banged in. Hit
in the woods where we was to camp for the
night. <i>Bon</i> welcome, eh? Stink? Whew!
Those woods did reek—had to bury our noses
in the ground to get to sleep. Well, the gas
came over strong. The Heinies threw bombs
down as regular as Christy Mathewson used
to heave strikes across the plate—and everybody
was scared as hell.</p>
<p>“Don’t let any man ever tell you he don’t
get scared at the front. He’s a damn liar if
he says he don’t get scared. Ain’t that you
want to run away or lose your guts in the
fightin’. No, not that kind of scared stuff.
It’s like this. There you are waitin’ for somethin’
to come along and take you off on some
strange trip. You know it’s goin’ to hurt
like hell gettin’ started, too. It’s that uncertain,
don’t-know stuff that gets you. When
those bombs are fallin’ and you’re in a place
like we was that night, with no place to go,
there’s nothin’ to do but pull a cheesecloth
blanket over your head and try to <i>cushay</i>.
Ain’t much fun, O. D. I had one hell of a
toothache and it worried me so much I didn’t
get a chance to be as scared as I should have
been. Funny how a thing like a toothache can
take your mind off other troubles.</p>
<p>“Things got so bad toward five bells in the
mornin’ that the C. O. decided to wake us up
and move. But before we could get set to
move the shellin’ let up and he says, ‘Ah, let
her go, we’ll stay.’ Camouflaged the old
<i>cheveaux</i> and stuff again and hung ’round
for breakfast. Course breakfast only meant
a thin slice of bacon and a fistful of hardtack.
The coffee had given out by that time. You
might expect that the supplies could have
reached us easy. But gettin’ supplies to us
was like findin’ a nigger in the dark. I swear
I believe we were lost durin’ most of the
Château-Thierry racket. Seems that way,
anyhow. For a long time after we left Mont
St. Pierre the batteries never did know where
the <i>échelons</i> were and the <i>échelons</i> didn’t know
where anything was. Mules, drivers, and
ration-carts used to get lost every day. That’s
why we were short of <i>café</i>.</p>
<p>“Put some over from there and got orders
to move up in the afternoon. The column had
just got formed and was waitin’ on the order
to pull when a drove of Boche birds headed
straight toward us. We knew they were
Boches long before they got close enough to
fire.</p>
<p>“‘Look at ’em comin’,’ shouted one guy,
and the whole crew popped their eyes out.</p>
<p>“I felt in my bones that we were in for a
good lickin’ of some kind, but I had my horse
to watch out for, so I was tied up, as it were.
Lots of the other guys were in the same fix
as me, and when the officer yelled, ‘Take
cover!’ we didn’t know what in hell to do.</p>
<p>“‘Tie your mounts to a wheel and beat it,’
says my platoon commander.</p>
<p>“Didn’t ask for any further orders. Tied
Jim so hard he couldn’t have answered mess-call.
Beat it to the edge of the woods and
dove under a ration-wagon. The Boches was
in range by then and they started a machine-gun
barrage. Worst thing I ever was in.
They had us by the halter-shanks, and maybe
they didn’t twist and squeeze! We didn’t
have nothin’ to get back at them birds with.
Blooey! The bombs started to fall and bust.</p>
<p>“An M. P. got crowned on the bean. He
had been walking post on the pontoon bridge.
Tumbled right in the river and floated away.
Then a bomb lands right in the middle of a
caisson team. Horses’ legs and wheels was
flyin’ in all directions. I couldn’t find my tin
hat and sure was glad that there was two
fellows layin’ on top of me as the machine-gun
bullets was zippin’ all ’round us. Everybody
was sayin’, ‘Where in hell is the American
birds? Why don’t they show?’ After
the Boches had a big chance to <i>finee</i> us and
the bridge, and missed out, a flock of Americans
and Frenchmen showed up and the
Dutchmen beat it <i>toot sweet</i>. That was one
of the Hairbreath Harry things that we had
happen that day. Believe me, there wasn’t
much time lost in gettin’ that column movin’
after that. When they counted up the casualties
it was found that there was ’bout twelve
guys killed, nine wounded, and we lost at
least eighteen <i>chevaux</i>. There you are, O. D.</p>
<p>“Moved toward Beuvardis that afternoon.
That took us northwest from the Marne and
farther in toward Swasson (Soissons), our
old hunting-grounds. There was some tough
fightin’ in there, believe me. The Boches
began to put up a mean defense; their artillery
was in position and the roads sure caught
hell for a while. I can’t remember all the
woods and hills we had to take and hold, but
there was <i>beaucoup</i> and it took <i>beaucoup</i> men
killed to make them objectives.</p>
<p>“The <i>monjayin’</i> got worse all the time and
our nerves began to get just like a ragged
toothache. So many of the fellows was gettin’
bumped off and hit ’round us that a man
couldn’t help wonderin’ if his own name
wasn’t written on a shell or bullet. I saw fat
guys get as lean as a penny stick of candy in
a week’s time. There wasn’t no chance to
shave or wash, so we all looked as wild as
cannibals soon. I never had any underclothes
after I threw away that stuff I got at Château-Thierry.
We slept full pack all the time and
the cooties had one big party all day and all
night. That was the time, durin’ the Second
Battle of the Marne, that young majors and
colonels got gray-headed.</p>
<p>“The second day out from St. Pierre was
the day that I had a big argument with a lieutenant
who blew by in a Ford. He was wearin’
a campaign hat. Course I felt superior like to
any man that was wearin’ a campaign hat in
them days. A campaign lid was the sign of an
S. O. S. bird, ’cause we had thrown ’em to the
salvage-men months ago.</p>
<p>“I was ploddin’ along ’way behind the column,
with Herb Carnes and another guy just
as lazy—my horse had been taken by a loot.
Course I happened to have my high hat on.
I’d lost my overseas cap, also my helmet. The
loot blows by. Never thought ’bout salutin’
him. That kind of stuff is a joke up at the
front, especially in a drive. He stops <i>toot
sweet</i> and calls us back.</p>
<p>“‘Why don’t you salute an officer?’ he asks
me.</p>
<p>“‘Salute?’ says I, kinda dumfounded.
‘Hell, we don’t go in for that kind of stuff in
this sector,’ I told him. You ought to seen
that man’s face.</p>
<p>“‘How long have you men been over
here?’</p>
<p>“‘Eleven months. How long have you been
here?’ I knew he had just landed. His Sam
Browne was new-lookin’.</p>
<p>“‘How does New York look without any
lights now?’ asked Carnes.</p>
<p>“Say, that officer must have felt like fifty
<i>centimes</i>. He saw my high hat ’bout that
time.</p>
<p>“‘Take that hat off. It isn’t regulation,’
says the second looey to me.</p>

    “‘TAKE THAT HAT OFF. IT ISN’T REGULATION,’ SAYS THE SECOND LOOEY TO ME”
  </div>
</div>
<p>“‘Regulation’s out of style up here,’ says
I. ‘It’s all I got; can’t take a chance of gettin’
sunstruck.’</p>
<p>“‘Don’t give a damn, take it off,’ he commands.</p>
<p>“I tipped my hat to him, bowed, and says,
‘Yes, sir.’ We moved on. ’Bout thirty minutes
later he blows by again and sees the hat
on me.</p>
<p>“‘Didn’t I tell you to take that hat off?’
he yells.</p>
<p>“‘Yes, sir,’ I yelled back, and tipped my
hat again.</p>
<p>“Never saw that gink after that, but it just
goes to show you how some of them guys
fought the <i>guerre</i>, runnin’ ’round in Fords
tryin’ to get salutes and make things, O. D.
You never see any of our officers doin’ that
kinda stuff. They know that it’s all bunk
after bein’ with the boys in the lines.</p>
<p>“Beauvardis, or just beyond it a few kilos,
is where Cap. Davis got it. We was ’way
up close to the front lines there. Had us in
front of the light pieces. There was a regiment
of seventy-fives right behind us. We
went into position in a place where the Boches
must have had a gun position, as the place
was littered up with their equipment and
<i>beaucoup</i> dead Germans. I didn’t get in until
late in the night, right in the middle of a
barrage that the seventy-fives was puttin’ up.
The woods was ringin’ with a noise that
sounded as if the devils themselves was
shoutin’ and yellin’ down in hell and we was
gettin’ a loud echo of it. Before us the whole
country was lit up by a big fire from a burnin’
German ammunition dump. Sure was weird
in them woods. I asked where I was to
<i>cushay</i>, and Frank Reynolds, top-kick, says,
‘Anywhere ’round here.’ Bickford and I
drops our load, spread the blankets, and tried
to <i>cushay</i>. No human bein’ could sleep much
in that place. But we managed to cork off a
little now and then. The woods smelled rotten.</p>
<p>“When daylight came I looked over my
head and saw an arm pointin’ right down at
me. There wasn’t no head or body. Just
that one arm. I got up quick as hell. Found
out I had been restin’ my head against a dead
Boche all night. Felt like runnin’, but was
afraid I might run right into the German
lines. They was only a few yards away over
a little hill.</p>
<p>“That mornin’ we got more movin’ orders.
Our doughboys had already been relieved by
the Forty-second Division infantry, as they
were all shot to hell. I’ll bet that there wasn’t
a full battalion left in any regiment. The
Rainbow doughboys can fight, now, buddy, I
ain’t jokin’. They made us artillery hump
to keep up with ’em, too. But guess we did,
as most of ’em said our barrages was as good
to go over under as an umbrella is in the rain.
There ain’t much use tellin’ much more.
Course, as I said, Cap. Davis got picked near
Beauvardis. He was steppin’ out of his P. C.
when a shell fragment knocked him cold.
Funny how all good men get it so quick. He
was only a kid, but, believe me, he had guts
and could handle a battery.</p>
<p>“We got up to Sergy Plateau and cleaned
the Germans off that place and they relieved
us. We had been in the drive from July fifteenth
to August fourth—that’s a long time
to battle, O. D. Accordin’ to reports, we
gained ’bout twenty-five kilometers against
the Boches. Not bad, eh?” concluded Jimmy,
starting to stretch.</p>
<p>“Gee! you had some war experience, Jimmy.
They sure must have given you a long
rest and furlough after all that time at the
front.”</p>
<p>“Rest? Hell, man, there ain’t no such thing
in this man’s army. Time we got pulled out
of Château-Thierry we went back to La Ferté
and waited there for trains to take us to a
rest area I got transferred back to Battery
C there. We was only in that rest area ten
days and while there I’ll bet we did more
work than at the front. We had hikes every
day and drillin’. They even tried to pull that
salutin’ stuff again. Only good thing ’bout
the rest area was that we could take a bath,
as there was <i>beaucoup</i> little creeks ’round,
and of course it’s warm here in August. On
the tenth day I was standin’ on a big lawn
with Samson and a couple of other guys lookin’
at the divisional minstrel. Right in the
middle of the song up jumps the C. O. of the
regiment and bawls out, ‘Men we’re off to
another fight!’ He must have been an actor
in civil life ’cause he sure did pull the old
dramatic stuff; believe he waited just for that
minute to spill the beans ’bout movin’ to another
front. That night we was on the old
road hikin’. Got on another French train.
Hit Bar-le-Duc two days ago, started hikin’
this way yesterday mornin’ and I got lost
from the gang last night. That’s all there is
to it, O. D. Just waitin’ for the <i>guerre</i> to <i>finee</i>
now. Then we’ll get a seven-day leave, <i>purtet</i>—that’s
what the Frogs say for perhaps.
What do you say to a little <i>cushayin’</i>, O. D.?
I get kinda drowsy in the eyes ’round <i>nerver</i>—used
to hittin’ the blankets ’bout seven bells
every night now, tryin’ to make up for time
lost at Château-Thierry.” Jimmy yawned to
show how true his statement was.</p>
<p>“Jimmy, you don’t mind if I tell some of
the things you said to Mary and mother in my
next letter, do you?” asked O. D., as he was
pullin’ his hobnails off.</p>
<p>“No—just so long as you don’t hit the
<i>guerre</i> stuff too hard. That red, battle-front
stuff ain’t good for their hearts, you <i>savvy</i>?
Gets ’em all scared for nothin’,” cautioned
Jimmy.</p>
<p>Both boys were tired and they were almost
asleep when Jimmy stirred and blurted out:</p>
<p>“Say, O. D., I forgot to tell you that you’re
liable to get <i>beaucoup</i> cooties <i>cushayin’</i> with
me. I’m crawlin’.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get them sooner or later, anyhow,
won’t I?” asked O. D.</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” assured the man with cooties.</p>
<p>“Then I might just as well get used to them
<i>toot sweet</i>,” declared the man who was about
to find out just what the thing that Jimmy
McGee called the <i>guerre</i> really meant.</p>
<p>“That’s the right dope. You won’t be long
gettin’ on the front if you’re willin’ to learn.
<i>Bon swoir</i>, O. D.” Jimmy felt mighty proud
of his new pupil, then he dropped off and
forgot the <i>guerre</i> in a dream of Mary Preston.</p>

</div>
<p class='ti0'>“<i>Bonjour</i>, O. D. How did you <i>cushay</i>?”
was Jimmy McGee’s greeting
to O. D. the next morning as he came out of
a sound sleep.</p>
<p>“Great sleeping in these beds, Jimmy.
Don’t know just how I’ll get out. Gee! I’m
down about four feet.”</p>
<p>“Yep. You’ve got to be a regular three-ring
circus acrobat to climb out of a French
<i>lee</i> without hurtin’ yourself,” admitted Jimmy
as he got a good hold on the side of the
bed and pulled himself out.</p>
<p>O. D. followed his example, but experienced
quite a lot of difficulty in doing so.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask madame to fix us up a little
<i>petit dayjunay</i> of some kind before we hit the
road again. Course a <i>petit dayjunay</i> ain’t
any too much in a marchin’ man’s stomach.
Means a bowl of <i>café</i> and a slice of bread.
We may be lucky to-day and run across a
truck-driver who’ll give us a lift. Them kind
of guys are mighty scarce in this army.
Frenchmen will give you a lift before an
American. Unless, of course, he belongs to
your division.”</p>
<p>While Jimmy was winding his last puttee
on, the madame came in the room and asked
him if he and his friend would eat. Jimmy
told her <i>oui</i> and the woman clattered out to
prepare the <i>café</i>.</p>
<p>“Now what do you think of <i>café-ooo-lay</i>,
O. D.?” asked Jimmy as he raised his bowl
to finish what was left.</p>
<p>“<i>Trey—</i>” O. D. stammered as if he had
forgotten just what he intended to say.</p>
<p>“<i>Trey-beans</i>, you want to say. That means
very good in French,” prompted Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Thanks. I’ll get it after a while, I guess.
But say, is beans a French word, too?”</p>
<p>“No. Don’t believe it is. But sounds
enough like French to use it O. K. The Frogs
understand it all right. Well, we’ll get strapped
up and on the way. Got to try and make
the outfit to-day. There’s somethin’ up in our
comin’ up here so sudden and we can’t afford
to miss anythin’. Got a hunch, O. D., that
the Boches is goin’ to get an awful beatin’ up
in these parts. Heard Frenchmen say it
wasn’t possible to drive the Germans out of
the positions they’ve got ’round Verdun and
St. Mihiel. Put a bunch of Americans in
there. I’ll bet all the pay they owe me, and
that’s three months now, that we’ll take Metz.
Say, O. D., I ’ain’t got over four francs.
How are you set on <i>frankers</i>?”</p>
<p>“I just got paid a few days ago. Let’s
see,” said O. D., counting his money. “Oh,
about sixty-five francs. How much do you
want?”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask madame how much we owe,”
answered Jimmy. “<i>Madame, combien?</i>”</p>
<p>The madame told him to wait a minute. She
got an old pencil and a piece of paper and
started figuring.</p>
<p>“It’s a fact, O. D., these Frogs can’t tell
you how much a glass of <i>van rouge</i> costs
without workin’ it out on paper. Ain’t it the
limit. Look at her now.”</p>
<p>Finally the madame reached a conclusion
of figures.</p>
<p>“<i>Dix francs</i>,” she told Jimmy.</p>
<p>“That’s ten francs or two dollars,” interpreted
Jimmy to O. D.</p>
<p>O. D. gave her a ten-franc note without
another word.</p>
<p>“That’s five francs I owe you, O. D. Keep
’count of that, will you?”</p>
<p>“Forget it, Jimmy. What I’ve got is
yours. <i>Compree?</i>” asked O. D., showing the
effect of association with McGee in his language.</p>
<p>“Gee! you’re gettin’ the stuff great. Well,
we’re off. <i>Bonjour, madame. Merci beaucoup</i>,”
said Jimmy, shaking hands with the
madame. O. D. did the same and mumbled
something that sounded like “<i>Banjo</i>.”</p>
<p>“<i>Au revoir, messieurs</i>,” responded the old
woman.</p>
<p>Down the village street they ambled like a
pair of old comrades.</p>
<p>Just as they were getting near the last
house on the <i>Grande Rue</i> a couple of American
soldiers came out of a barn door. Hay
was sticking to their clothes and around
their necks and heads. They approached
Jimmy and O. D.</p>
<p>“What outfit, buddy?” asked the first one
to Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Twenty-sixth division. Know where any
of the Twenty-sixth is ’bout here?” was Jimmy’s
question.</p>
<p>“You’re gang got a YD painted on all your
stuff?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>,” answered Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Well, there was artillery passed through
here yesterday noon—<i>beaucoup</i> of it—whole
regiment about. Say have you seen anything
of the Twenty-eighth Division? We got lost
a few days ago. ’Ain’t been able to locate
’em yet.”</p>
<p>“No, can’t say I know where you’re outfit
is. Which way did that artillery go?”</p>
<p>“Straight up the Verdun road toward
Souilly. Find anything to <i>monjay</i> or drink
here?” asked the Twenty-eighth Division man.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, got <i>beaucoup pom du tear fritz, dey
zerfs</i>, and <i>van rouge</i> down the line there,”
and Jimmy pointed out the house where he
and O. D. had spent the night.</p>
<p>“<i>Merci.</i> Well, be good and take care.
Just out of Château-Thierry, ain’t you?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui.</i> So long, fellows!” answered Jimmy,
and he and O. D. hiked on toward Verdun.</p>
<p>During the course of two kilometers three
trucks passed the hikers. Chances of riding
looked <i>pas bons</i> to them when another truck
appeared on the crest of a high hill, making
toward them.</p>
<p>“Maybe this guy’ll have a heart. We’ll
stop here and look tired as hell,” said Jimmy,
stopping on the roadside.</p>
<p>The truck came closer.</p>
<p>“Hell afire! Believe it’s a YD truck, O. D.”</p>
<p>“How ’bout a lift, buddy?” shouted Jimmy
as the truck was almost up to them.</p>
<p>The driver slowed down and let them climb
on.</p>
<p>“What outfit, buddy?” he asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>“One Hundred and Third Field Artillery,
Jack.”</p>
<p>“Thought you looked like a YD man,” answered
the driver as he changed gears.</p>
<p>They made about four kilometers when the
driver complained of feeling hot. He stopped
his truck and started taking off his leather
jerkin. There was a Croix de Guerre pinned
over his heart. O. D. saw it and his eyes
bulged out.</p>
<p>“I see you’re a hero,” said O. D., pointing
to the bronze medal attached to the green
ribbon.</p>
<p>“Hero, hell!” exclaimed the driver. “Anybody
can get one of these things. The Frogs
wear ’em as souvenirs of the <i>guerre</i>. You
can buy a dozen for a few francs. I was
lucky enough to have this one given to me,”
he explained.</p>
<p>“What did you do, swipe a bag of white
sugar and give it to some French general?”
asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell you, buddy, this thing was
given to me for bravery under fire and devotion
to duty. That’s the way the paper
read, anyhow. I was drivin’ up to Château-Thierry
in this junk with some bread. Got
pretty near Saacy when I run into <i>beaucoup</i>
shell-fire. The big boys was bustin’ ahead of
me and behind me—all around me. Wasn’t
anything else to do so I climbs down and gets
under the engine, thinkin’ that the truck would
give me a bit of protection from splinters.
Had on my jumpers and in my jumpers was
a little hammer. Lucky for me it was. A
bunch of Frogs includin’ a colonel gets chased
out of the woods by shells. Happens that
they come straight toward me. I had sense
enough to start tinkerin’ with the engine so
as to leave a good impression. The colonel
spots me. He could talk some English. Tells
me all kinds of bull about bein’ brave under
shell-fire. I didn’t spoil his speech by tellin’
him I was scared to death. He takes my
name and outfit. Few weeks later I get a
paper citin’ me and givin’ me right to wear
a Craw de Guerre. Well, I stayed right under
there tappin’ away until the shellin’ quit,
which happened <i>toot sweet</i>. Can you beat it?
The <i>guerre’s</i> a farce so long as it don’t get
you, eh, buddy?” to Jimmy.</p>
<p>“I’ll say so. That’s what I tell my friend
here. He ’ain’t never been up yet,” answered
Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Never seen the front, eh, Jack?” this to
O. D.</p>
<p>“No, not yet,” admitted O. D.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll be disappointed if you’re
lookin’ for all that you heard tell about. Once
you get used to starvin’, wearin’ one suit of
underclothes about three months, and <i>cushayin’</i>
out in any old mud-hole there won’t be
much excitement for you. All the other
things depend on your own good luck. If
the Kaiser ’ain’t got your number you’ll pull
through without a scratch. I know. I was in
the infantry not long ago.”</p>
<p>Jimmy and the Yankee division truck-driver
fought the battles of Château-Thierry all over
again while O. D. listened and didn’t miss a
word. The things that the veterans talked
and laughed about caused his mind a thousand
and one perplexities. He had always formed
his ideas and pictures of the front according
to the suggestion and impressions of men and
women who painted the existence on the lines
as a red hell-life of misery and sufferings.</p>
<p>He could only conceive the front as a sinister,
shadowy place, abounding in terrors and
hardships, where men were fighting one another
day and night, while the guns roared
away incessantly. But beside him were two
boys who spoke of the front as if it were a
playground of strange adventure where by
mere accident, rather than by deliberate execution,
men were killed or wounded. He was
certain, instinctively, that these boys knew
what they were talking of. He knew that
men cannot tell about living with death, while
laughing and singing of life, unless they
have actually done such a thing.</p>
<p>O. D. heard Jimmy tell of buying a suit of
underclothes at La Ferté, after his outfit had
been taken out of the fight shattered to the
bone from continual battling. He judged
from the way Jimmy said it that he would
remember buying that forty-franc suit of
underclothes when his memory of the capture
of Hill 190 would grow dim. Jimmy cussed
more because the army was unable to give him
underclothes at that time than he did over the
fact that he had to lug ninety-five-pound
shells on a stomach that had been empty for
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>O. D. wondered if he would ever be able to
understand the life of the front as his new
friend Jimmy did. He wondered if there was
enough good stuff in him to make him accept
his burden of front-line work like the other
men who had already gone in and proved
themselves. O. D. wondered a hundred things
that were all closely associated with the fact
that he was about to enter a life that would
bring him face to face with supreme sacrifice.
Like a hundred thousand other American
boys, before and after him, O. D. saw the bigness
of the test that awaited every young
novice on the battle-field, and he was concerned
only with the one question: “Can I
make good?”</p>
<p>“Well, here we are at Heippes,” said the
driver, cutting a story of the capture of Vaux
short. “Your outfit’s up ’round Souilly, I
think. I turn off here and go out toward
Rambluzen. Be good, Jack, and take care of
your friend here,” indicating O. D.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, bet your life. <i>Au revoir</i>, old man,”
answered Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said O. D.</p>
<p>“Not at all, Jack; glad to give you a lift,”
shouted the driver, and he was off.</p>
<p>“That’s a regular guy,” said Jimmy. “You
take any fellow that’s been through what we
have and he’s damn glad to help a guy out.
He knows himself what it is to be hungry
and tired. This old war’s teachin’ a few guys
that there’s others in the world besides themselves.
Guess it’s time to <i>monjay</i>. Take a
look for the <i>café</i> here. Hold it here a minute.
I’ll ask this M. P. guy where a man
can get a bite.” Jimmy headed for an M. P.</p>
<p>“Say, Jack, where’s there a place to <i>monjay</i>
’round here?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t tell you, buddy. Only been here
a week,” answered the M. P.</p>
<p>“A week,” repeated Jimmy. “What do
you have to do, spend a winter in a place to
find out where the grub is? Have you seen
artillery go by here lately?”</p>
<p>“Nope—nothin’ lately—in three days or
so.”</p>
<p>“What was it, seventy-fives or one hundred
and fifty-fives—big or little? What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t remember,” answered the M. P. as
he motioned a car to go by.</p>
<p>“Hell afire, O. D., I knew it. Those M. P.’s
don’t even know there’s a <i>guerre</i> goin’ on,”
said Jimmy, with disgust. “Follow me, I’ll
find somethin’ <i>toot sweet</i>,” and Jimmy McGee
started toward a house about one hundred
feet away.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER XII—O. D. MEETS JIMMY’S GANG</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>After going through the same old stuff
with the madame, Jimmy, with the
help of Gabrielle, madame’s nineteen-year-old
daughter, finally succeeded in arranging for
a dinner of <i>pomme de terre frites</i> and an
omelet.</p>
<p>While they were washing up a little bit,
Gabrielle told Jimmy that there were three
Americans sleeping in the house. The girl
told him that the Americans had arrived the
night before, tired out and hungry. None of
them had got up yet, she told him.</p>
<p>Jimmy was just taking a man’s share of
the potatoes when the door in front of him
opened.</p>
<p>“Jimmy McGee! You old son of a gun!
What in hell!”</p>
<p>“George Neil!” shouted Jimmy as he
rushed at the new-comer and nearly bowled
him off his feet. “How did you get in here?”</p>
<p>“<i>Cushayed</i> too long and the outfit left me
back in some little joint ten kilos or so from
Bar-le-Duc. Joyce and Pop Rigney are still
<i>cushayin’</i>. Who’s your friend?” asked Neil,
pointing to O. D.</p>
<p>“Oh, hell, I almost forgot. This is O. D.
Picked him up yesterday; he’s goin’ to the
outfit as a replacement. Meet my pal, George
Neil, O. D.”</p>
<p>“Glad to know you, sergeant,” said O. D.,
shaking Neil’s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>“Forget the sergeant stuff, old man. Glad
to meet anybody that Jimmy McGee knows.
But what did you say that your name was?”</p>
<p>“It’s William G. Preston, but Jimmy—,”
answered O. D.</p>
<p>“I changed it to O. D. Don’t you think
that’s better, George. Look at the way he’s
rigged up,” interrupted Jimmy.</p>
<p>“You’re right, Jimmy. Where did you enlist
from, O. D.?” asked Neil.</p>
<p>“He was drafted. But that don’t make any
difference. Wasn’t his fault he didn’t volunteer.
I got his whole story and it’s straight.
He’s one of us from now on and I’m goin’
to get him in the outfit,” declared Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Good stuff—shake on that, O. D.,” and
George Neil shook hands with the drafted
man to show him how he felt.</p>
<p>“<i>Messieurs, voluez-vous manger?</i>” (Messieurs,
will you eat?)</p>
<p>“Bet your life. <i>Oui, mademoiselle, toot
sweet</i>,” answered McGee as he began getting
chairs up to the table.</p>
<p>“Let those two mopes <i>cushay</i>. We’ll <i>monjay</i>
and then call ’em out,” suggested Neil.</p>
<p>In answer to his suggestion the door of
the room that he had been sleeping in opened
and a bald head stuck out.</p>
<p>“Look out, Pop—cover that bald dome up.
You’re too old to be goin’ ’round uncovered,”
warned Jimmy.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you how old I am if I get skinned
out of those <i>poms</i> and <i>dey zerfs</i>,” shot back
Pop Rigney, as he pulled his bald head behind
the protection of the door. He began
talking to Joyce, who was still in bed, and the
men at the table knew that Pop was warning
him to dash for the table unless he wanted to
starve.</p>
<p>The meal progressed as all meals do when
young American soldiers are eating in a
French home, with much misunderstanding
as to the exact meaning of the things that are
said in the French and English languages.
Gabrielle laughed over their funny way of
talking her native language and tried to
help matters by using her only stock and
store of English, which was represented by
the words “yes” and “finish.”</p>
<p>“I want some water myself,” admitted
Jimmy, after finishing his meal, “but I’m
scared to ask for it after last night.”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask her,” volunteered Neil.</p>
<p>“Gabrielle,” he called.</p>
<p>She answered with a big, wonderful smile
and came over to him.</p>
<p>“<i>Donnay mwa</i> glass <i>de low</i>,” was Neil’s
way of telling her his want.</p>
<p>Gabrielle looked helplessly at the empty
dishes. A little frown of perplexity showed
on her forehead. Gradually the frown was
camouflaged by a spreading smile of understanding
light.</p>
<p>“Oh, finish?” she asked him.</p>
<p>“Great Lord, ’ain’t she got wonderful blue
eyes!” ejaculated Neil. “Some of these peasant
girls are sure the darb. Wish I could
<i>parley</i> her talk.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get that water myself,” said Jimmy,
rising. He found a glass and went outside to
look for a pump. Gabrielle watched him
smilingly, wishing that she could comprehend
the wants of the big, good-natured American
boys with whom she found it so easy to make
friends.</p>
<p>“’Ain’t been over long, have you?” asked
Neil of O. D. as Jimmy disappeared through
the doorway.</p>
<p>“Just about two months. Spent all my time
down at the replacement camps waiting to be
sent to some outfit.”</p>
<p>“Well, you are gettin’ in with a darn good
outfit and Jimmy’s a great guy for a friend.
He’ll show you ’round the front.”</p>
<p>“Guess I’ll feel kind of funny going up
there with all you fellows that are used to it,”
said O. D.</p>
<p>“Not at all; you’ll never know the difference.
Two or three days and you’ll think
you’ve been there all your life. After a
month you’ll hardly ever know you used to
live in a house back in the States. Gets in
your blood. Just like the mud up there gets
all over you. Make friends with the cooties.
Then you’re all set,” explained Neil.</p>
<p>“Jerk aloose from that table and let two
good men <i>monjay</i>,” shouted Pop Rigney and
Joyce, pushing their door open and making
for what was left in one of the dishes.</p>

    “MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE COOTIES. THEN YOU’RE ALL SET”
  </div>
</div>
<p>“Meet Jimmy’s friend, O. D. This is Pop
Rigney, the oldest man in this man’s army,
and the other fellow is Joyce, our supply sergeant.”
The men shook hands all around and
sat down.</p>
<p>“I got that water. Had to walk almost a
mile to find it,” said Jimmy, entering. “Well,
Rigney, you old bald-headed monkey, you got
up, eh? Guess Joyce’s mess-hound appetite
did it. Well, you can <i>monjay</i> what I left.”</p>
<p>Rigney and Joyce got enough by accepting
odds and ends. When they finished it was
agreed that the party move on and catch the
outfit.</p>
<p>“<i>Combien, Gabrielle?</i>” asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>“<i>Dix france, pour tous</i>,” she answered.
(Ten francs for everything.)</p>
<p>“Not bad at all. Gettin’ kinda sick of the
highway-robbery stuff. Guess you’ll have to
pay, George; I’m flat,” said Jimmy.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>,” answered Neil. He gave Gabrielle
three five-franc notes and told her to keep the
change.</p>
<p><i>“Monsieur, vous donney trop!</i> (you give
too much, monsieur) she told him, insisting
that he take what was over and above.</p>
<p>“Forget it,” refusing the returned money.</p>
<p>“<i>Merci bien, monsieur</i>,” answered Gabrielle.</p>
<p><i>Au revoirs</i> were quickly said. The little
party of Yanks started off in the general
direction of Verdun over the great white highway
that many Frenchmen call the “Sacred
Road.”</p>
<p>“Got any idea where the outfit is, Joyce?”
asked O. D., after two kilometers had been
left behind with their hobnail tracks.</p>
<p>“Heard they’re right near Souilly. Believe
they’ll hang there a day or so and then go
into the lines. Big stuff on up here. Heard
about it?”</p>
<p>“Lot of rumors ’bout a big smash, but
nothin’ certain. What dope did you get?”
asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Nothin’ but that everybody from the big
guys down are looking for a drive to start and
go through to Metz. Dope is we start the push
on early in September, about the tenth or so.
’Ain’t got any too much time.”</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll be right up in the front end of
this thing. Better get us some new <i>chevaux</i>.
I’m tired listening to that ‘Cannoneer on the
Wheel,’ stuff,” snorted Rigney.</p>
<p>“If it’ll end this <i>guerre</i> any quicker I’m
with ’em to drive all winter,” declared Jimmy.</p>
<p>O. D. listened to his new friends talk about
driving and pushing, and many other things
that happen only at the front, with the feeling
that he was a rank outsider in their company.
They spoke so casually of attacking the Germans
and taking Metz that O. D. could not
dissuade himself from believing that at times
war must be a sort of picnic. Yet something
told him that while these men spoke as lightly
as they did of fighting they knew the hell of
it, too. He wondered again and again if when
it came his time to learn, as they had done
before him, he would be able to accept the fun
and hell just as they did. That thought worried
O. D. more than anything else.</p>
<p>“How far is that place where you think
the outfit is?” asked old Pop Rigney. The
five kilometers that brought them to another
little village had brought some aches and
weariness to his aging limbs.</p>
<p>“Another kilometer or two, I guess,” answered
Joyce.</p>
<p>“Better grab a truck. You don’t know
where we’re going,” was Rigney’s suggestion.</p>
<p>“Gosh! There’s a Y. M. C. A. sign. Let’s
go over and get some cigarettes. No tellin’ if
we’ll ever see them again. Gettin’ up close
now, you know,” warned Jimmy.</p>
<p>“We’re off,” said Neil.</p>
<p>The quintet made for the Y. M. C. A. hut.</p>
<p>“Any cigarettes?” asked Joyce of the man
behind the canteen counter.</p>
<p>“Not to-day. All out of smokings,” was
the disappointing answer.</p>
<p>“Any chocolate or cookies?” questioned
Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Expect stuff in to-morrow. Hard to get
transportation,” curtly.</p>
<p>“Oh, well. We’ll live through it,” said
Jimmy.</p>
<p>Once outside Pop Rigney said what he
thought.</p>
<p>“What the hell is wrong with them guys?
Always the same old stuff—’Out to-day; come
to-morrow. I’m off ’em,” declared Pop.</p>
<p>“Damn if I know. Look at the Château-Thierry
times when we never was able to get
the stuff. I’m for the Salvation Army every
time,” announced Jimmy.</p>
<p>“We used to have darn good Y. M. C. A.’s
back at the replacement camps. Always had
lots of cigarettes, chocolate, and cakes. Twice
a week we had pictures and shows,” stated
O. D.</p>
<p>“Sure, ’way back in the S. O. S.—why
wouldn’t they have everything? What good
is that doin’ the guys up at the front where
you can’t buy the stuff. Just like the eats and
clothes. Back in the States I guess the folks
think that all the good stuff goes up to the
fightin’ men. Like hell it does,” snapped
Jimmy.</p>
<p>A big green truck approached them.</p>
<p>“Hell, there’s the Regimental Supply truck.
Let’s climb on,” shouted Neil as he started
running to meet the camion.</p>
<p>“Make it fast, boys,” said Champ, the
driver, “I got to get back to camp and make
another trip for supplies before night. We’re
movin’ up to-morrow, you know.”</p>
<p>“Good stuff. Where ’re we goin’? Anybody
know?” asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Yep; near a place that sounds like Rupt.
Something else tacked onto it, but don’t
remember. We’re goin’ to start this drive
soon.”</p>
<p>“Gettin’ any fresh beef in for supplies
now?” asked Joyce.</p>
<p>“<i>Beaucoup</i> ‘canned willy’; that’s about
all,” replied Champ.</p>
<p>“Get ready to <i>monjay</i> that stuff another
two months, I guess. Wouldn’t it give a man
a pain!” groaned Neil.</p>
<p>“There’s the gang over yonder along that
road. See ’em?” asked Champ, pointing to a
road over to the left.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, pretty good camouflage; but you can
tell it,” answered Jimmy.</p>
<p>“I don’t see anything. Where do you
mean?” asked O. D.</p>
<p>“All along that road. See the tree branches
and stuff that looks like it’s growin’ out in
the road. That’s the guns and stuff. They’re
camouflaged on account of Boche planes. The
horses are down in the woods some place,”
explained Jimmy.</p>
<p>“I see now what you mean. Gee! that
camouflage is fine stuff; I’d never know it was
anything from here,” admitted O. D.</p>
<p>“You’ll pick camouflage from the real stuff
<i>toot sweet</i>, O. D.; don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Say, we better hit the road here and slip
in. Some boob may ask what we’re doin’
blowin’ in at this time of day,” suggested
Joyce.</p>
<p>The crew acted on his advice and approached
the camp from the woods.</p>
<p>Just before gaining the fringe of road
where pieces, caissons, wagons, and a lot of
equipment were hidden beneath newly cut
branches, a bugle blasted out “Attention!”</p>
<p>“A Boche plane goin’ over. That means
take cover, O. D.,” explained McGee.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the bugle sounded recall
and everybody went about their business with
little ado.</p>
<p>Jimmy brought O. D. up to Regimental
Headquarters, and by a little stroke of army
diplomacy got Sergeant-Major Creamer to
assign him to Battery C. Later he went to
the captain with Jimmy and asked that O. D.
be assigned to the same section as himself.</p>
<p>“Put him in your gun crew, if you want to.
You’ve got to be acting gunner-corporal now.
Corporal Schott went to the hospital with
fever,” said the captain.</p>
<p>“<i>Trey-beans</i>,” answered Jimmy. “Thanks
<i>beaucoup</i>.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” answered the C. O.</p>
<p>“Great guy, our old man,” Jimmy told O. D.
when they got out of the captain’s hearing.
“Just like one of the fellows all the time. We
call him Pop Henderson. He knows it, too.
I believe you could call him Pop to his face
and he’d take it all right. Course we don’t,
you know. He’s too good. Bunch of officers
like him in this outfit. There ’re cranks and
bums in every profession, but our officers are
pretty much the darb. Get that way after
bein’ up at the front with you a long time,
you see.”</p>
<p>“Seemed mighty nice,” said O. D. “Where
are we going to sleep to-night, Jimmy?”</p>
<p>“Oh, we’ll rig up our shelter-halves and
<i>cushay</i> in the woods some place. Won’t be as
good as that Frog bed we hit last night, but
<i>say la guerre</i>, you know O. D.”</p>
<p>“I’m willing, Jimmy.”</p>
<p>“This place is as good as any, I guess,”
said Jimmy, examining the ground with his
foot. “There’s a few damn loots in the way,
but if you get yourself wrapped around then
you’ll <i>cushay bon</i>.”</p>
<p>Jimmy didn’t try to put the tent up in
regulation way. He got a few small branches,
a stick or two, and with the poles that O. D.
had he made a shelter that would at least
keep some wind away or afford protection
against rain.</p>
<p>“I lost all my pins and poles ’round Château-Thierry,”
he said in apology for using
his bayonet as a tent-pin.</p>
<p>Jimmy had two blankets and O. D. had three.
They spread them all out on the ground,
tucked in the end near the opening of the
tent and crawled between the blankets, leaving
two between them and the earth.</p>
<p>“Roll your blouse up and use it for a pillow.
Generally I use my gas-mask, sometimes
my tin hat, for a pillow, if it’s cold and
I’m alone. Neil and I used to <i>cushay</i> together,
but he can hang with Pop or Joyce, as he
knows how to get along here.”</p>

<div class='chapter' id='ch_XIII'>
<div class='c'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER XIII—“WE’RE GOIN’ TO TAKE METZ.”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>O. D. turned restlessly for a long time
before he could adapt his body to the
topography of the ground that was his bed.
He had funny feelings in his joints as if something
was grinding against the bones, especially
when he remained in one position long.
Jimmy’s snoring told him that his new friend
was asleep.</p>
<p>The new-comer to the environs of the front
lay awake almost two hours. He thought of
home, of his mother, of Mary, and of what was
before him. Now and then a distant rumbling
as if thunder was muttering in far-away
skies came to his ears.</p>
<p>Jimmy had explained the rumbling as being
the noise of guns that were perhaps twenty
kilometers away. O. D. couldn’t put down
the idea that he was near the front, the thing
that he had been working toward since becoming
a soldier. The idea gripped him so
strongly that he couldn’t stay the restless
feelings which worked through his veins fire-like.</p>
<p>He sat up, reached for his shoes, slipped
them on, and crawled out of the tent.</p>
<p>The night was singularly clear for France.
A growing moon and myriad stars had purged
the world of shadows and given it a generous
possession of silver light. Except for the soft
noises made by the horses and the occasional
rumble that came from the hills of Verdun,
the night was quiet and suggestive of peaceful
repose.</p>
<p>O. D. looked and listened at the things of
the night. A sentry strolled leisurely along
the road where the guns of his regiment were
camouflaged. Far in front of him a chain of
golden rockets climbed against the horizon
and disappeared as if by magic. The thing
that O. D. had thought was thunder came to
his ears again. Then all was so quiet that he
could hear Jimmy sleeping.</p>
<p>“I’m almost at the front,” soliloquized the
man to himself. “No one else seems to know
it, or feel it, but me. Guess I better try to
sleep.” He turned to go back in the pup
tent.</p>
<p>A soft, subdued thing like the drone of a
bee rose and fell on the night air. O. D.
jumped forward a trifle, startled by the sinister
beelike noise that seemed almost overhead.</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat-tat! B-o-o-m! B-o-o-m! Rat-tat-tat-tat!</p>
<p>The peace of the night ended in the fierce
barking of machine-guns and the crash of anti-air-craft
cannon. Between shots, the soft
droning that came from the skies continued
in a casual, business-like way that caused cold
perspiration to come unbidden to O. D.’s forehead.</p>
<p>B—A—N—G!</p>
<p>A bomb exploded about four hundred yards
from where O. D. stood, and the ground quivered
beneath him.</p>
<p>The sound of waking men stirred him to
speak.</p>
<p>“What—— What is it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nothin’ but a Boche plane droppin’
bombs. They’re goin’ at him with the archies,
but might just as well use pea-shooters. Never
get a plane with that stuff,” came the answer
from a dark part of the woods.</p>
<p>W-h-i-r-r!</p>
<p>Something was passing directly overhead.
O. D. looked up. He saw a black shadow flit
between himself and the moon. Then another
bomb exploded. O. D. dived into the tent. He
landed on Jimmy.</p>
<p>“What the hell’s up?” asked Jimmy, coming
out of sleep.</p>
<p>“Listen,” whispered O. D. in a hoarse
voice.</p>
<p>Jimmy listened.</p>
<p>“Nothin’ but some Boche planes, I guess.
They’ll never get us, but I hate ’em just the
same. Turn over and let’s <i>cushay encore</i>.”</p>
<p>O. D. lay down again, but did not sleep until
the droning had ceased and the guns had
become quiet. Fatigue finally overpowered his
senses and he fell into deep slumber.</p>
<p>“Wake up, O. D. Time to <i>monjay</i>.”
Jimmy, fully dressed, was bending over O. D.</p>
<p>“What—— Oh—— Time to get up and
eat, eh? What have they got for breakfast,
Jimmy?”</p>
<p>“Bacon, hardtack, and coffee. The coffee’s
got sugar in it for a wonder. Make it fast or
we’ll get nothin’ but seconds.”</p>
<p>Sitting bolt upright in the little tent, O. D.
took account of the fact that Jimmy was
all ready and showed signs of having been up
some time.</p>
<p>“You have been up and around, Jimmy;
why didn’t you wake me up before?” asked
O. D.</p>
<p>“What’s the use? You’ll get enough early
rising before you’re through with this outfit.
Might as well beat the army out of a little
sleep when you can. When you come down
to brass tacks about it, every time you <i>cushay</i>
late and <i>monjay</i> a lot you’re makin’ yourself
stronger and a better man for the army work.
<i>Cushay</i> all you can, O. D. We had to get up
at six and feed them soft-headed horses and
bring ’em down to a little lake to water. Come
on if you’re set and we’ll beat it up to the
mess-line.”</p>
<p>O. D. and Jimmy, mess-kits and cups in
hand, found their way through the woods to
the long line of hungry men that extended
from the smoking, rolling kitchen to a point
almost one hundred yards away.</p>
<p>O. D. had never looked upon such a motley
group of American soldiers since entering the
army. Most of the boys were in their shirt-sleeves.
Some wore leggings and some did
not. Half of them did not have caps or hats
on. They were all mud-splashed. Everybody
was either talking or laughing.</p>
<p>“When are we goin’ to eat?” asked one
man near the end of the line. A rattle of
mess-kits followed that question, and soon the
entire mess-line began to bawl out the cooks
and kitchen police in general.</p>
<p>“Look at the ears on him!” shouted a Yank.
A chorus of laughs followed.</p>
<p>O. D., falling in line behind Jimmy, heard
that remark and turned red in the face.</p>
<p>“Why did he say that, Jimmy? Are my
ears big, or what?” he asked.</p>
<p>Jimmy laughed.</p>
<p>“They’re not talkin’ ’bout you, O. D. That’s
just a sayin’ in this man’s army which is more
popular ’round mess-time than any other.
Don’t worry ’bout these guys gettin’ fresh
with you,” answered Jimmy.</p>
<p>The top-sergeant stopped Jimmy and O. D.
as they were making their way back from
mess.</p>
<p>“Say, Jimmy, is this the new guy?” asked
the top, indicating O. D.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui.</i> Pop Henderson said I could get him
in my crew.”</p>
<p>“<i>Trey-beans.</i> You’ll fix him up, then. Have
you had any time on the guns?” he asked
O. D.</p>
<p>“No. I was in the infantry.”</p>
<p>“What about that, Jimmy?”</p>
<p>“I’ll show him ’round that baby of ours.
He don’t need no trainin’ for the job I’m goin’
to give him,” declared McGee.</p>
<p>“Well, be good to him. Luck to you, old
man,” and the top hurried away to scare up
some details for grooming the horses.</p>
<p>“We pull up to-night, O. D.—not right into
the front, you know. About three kiloflappers
from where our positions will be. So I want
to get down to the piece and look her over.
Got to get Betsy in great shape for this
drive. We’re goin’ to take Metz. You heard
that, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I thought Metz was the German’s
stronghold and a long ways off,”
answered O. D.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui.</i> What of it? We’ll take it all right.
Wait till this old Yankee army gets loose at
’em.” Jimmy spoke with a confidence which
O. D. hadn’t yet learned to grasp.</p>
<p>The day was spent by Jimmy in cleaning
and getting Betsy, his faithful Schneider howitzer
of 155-millimeter range, in condition for
the work that was in store for it. O. D. got a
chance to familiarize his fingers and sight with
the parts that were henceforth to engage his
attention while a member of Jimmy McGee’s
gun crew.</p>
<p>A few minutes before supper final moving
orders were announced. The regiment was to
hike twenty-four kilometers and camouflage in
a woody valley near Rupt-en-Woevre.</p>
<p>Jimmy, standing around with O. D. and
Neil, hearing the orders, remarked.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine this stuff back in the
States? Suppose a guy blew in your office
just before supper and told you to grab your
typewriter and hike eighteen miles or so.
Why, man, you’d throw him down ten flights
of stairs. Over here they tell you to load up
with a hundred pounds of junk and hike
twenty-odd kilometers, and you do it like you
was goin’ off to a dance. Don’t know what
the hell we’ll do when we do get back.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER XIV—“WELL, WE’RE HERE.”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>After the usual amount of orders and
rescinding of orders had been accomplished
the regiment was lined up in a column
of three battalions and awaited the command
“forward.”</p>
<p>Just as the sun fell behind the green hills of
Verdun and the shadows of night began to
fill the valleys a long column of American
artillery started rolling toward the lines of
the St. Mihiel sector. Jimmy McGee and
William G. Preston, alias O. D., loaded down
under their equipment and carrying canes,
followed behind Betsy, the third piece of Battery
C, humming the chorus of “Where Do
We Go from Here, Boys?”</p>
<p>It was two o’clock in the morning when the
regiment reached its rendezvous in a wooded
valley near Rupt-en-Woevre. The sky had
become clouded and the early morning was
jet black.</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll get soaked, O. D.,” prophesied
Jimmy when they halted and got a
chance to observe the weather conditions.</p>
<p>“Will we stay here now?” asked O. D.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>. Might just as well scare up a place
to <i>cushay</i>. Wait here; I’ll look ’round.”</p>
<p>A little while later Jimmy returned with
the news that there was nothing to do but put
the pup tent up again and sleep on the ground.</p>
<p>“There’s one barrack here, but the First Battalion
guys grabbed that as they got here
first,” he explained.</p>
<p>Jimmy and O. D. put the tent up on the
slope of a hill that formed the eastern side
of the valley in which the horses and <i>matériel</i>
of the entire regiment were hidden.</p>
<p>O. D. heard, in a sort of indifferent manner,
the growl of big guns that seemed very
near. He was startled once or twice by the
crash of bombs and the anti-air-craft guns.
But he was too tired to lend ears and thoughts
to such things on his first night at the front,
for the regiment was only a few kilometers
from the first lines. O. D. fell asleep immediately
and didn’t wake until three hours later
when a downpour of rain splashed him from
head to foot.</p>
<p>The wind that accompanied the rain swept
the tent away time and time again. Everything
that Jimmy and O. D. owned got soaked.
The earth beneath them turned into crawling
slime. Finally, seeing the impossibility of
keeping the tent up, Jimmy told his friend to
pull his shelter-half over him, head and all.
Jimmy did likewise with his shelter-half and
blankets. The two boys, wrapped in canvas
and blankets, lay in the deluge like two muffled
mummies, trying to sleep.</p>
<p>Instead of moving into position at once the
regiment made at least fifty final preparations
to do so, only to be ordered to remain in the
valley for further orders.</p>
<p>Four days passed. Rain fell incessantly.
The bottom of the valley became as slippery
as glass. Men bogged up to their knees in
mud. There were no boots. The mess was
a succession of “corned willy,” hardtack, and
sugarless coffee meals.</p>
<p>At last, when every man and officer had
reached the point of absolute disgust, the
guns were dragged out of their mud-holes and
hauled by horse and man power to the positions
from which they were scheduled to
launch their part of the drive.</p>
<p>Passing through the shell-torn village of
Rupt-en-Woevre, the Second Battalion, of
which Jimmy’s battery was a part, swerved
off the main road and followed a woods trail
that seemed to lead straight into the noises
and strange, mysterious lights of the front.</p>
<p>A gun barked out, not forty feet from the
road. O. D. looked to Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Are we at the front now Jimmy?” he
asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>“Don’t know myself. Guess there’s a battery
in the woods near here. We’ll be there
soon now.”</p>
<p>The firing was not very heavy that night.
Occasionally a big gun spoke or the staccato
voices of machine-guns stabbed the night air
intermittently. Flares and rockets went up
frequently, causing the darkness of the woods
that bordered the road to accentuate. O. D.
owned some strange, indescribable feelings at
times, but he could not identify any of them
as the sensations which he had expected to
experience upon his first intimacy with the
things of the front.</p>
<p>The column halted at a crossroad. Orders
to dismount came quickly and were repeated
down the line of guns in ordinary tones. Before
O. D. had a chance to ask what was going
on platoon commanders had issued instructions
for the piece teams to haul the
guns into certain positions nearby.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re here. Now for the business,”
declared Jimmy.</p>
<p>“You mean we are at the front,” gasped
O. D., incredulously. “I thought—”</p>
<p>“Sure, we all thought the same thing when
we came up the first time. Looked for signposts
sayin’, ‘This is the front,’ or a bunch
of Germans tryin’ to get us. Just like that
No-Man’s-Land stuff. I’d heard so much
about that place before comin’ to France that
I thought it would be as easy to find as a
piece of choice real estate. Kinda expected
that it would be a square field, or somethin’
like that, between two story-book trenches.
First No Man’s Land I ran into was in the
middle of a village. Graveyard and church
made most of it. The front’s built on the
same idea.”</p>
<p>Jimmy selected a spot near the third piece
and arranged a place for himself and O. D.
Before O. D. fell asleep he mentioned that
he wanted to write some letters to his mother
and Mary.</p>
<p>At the sound of Mary’s name Jimmy instinctively
ran his hand over his breast pocket
to see if the picture was still there. It was.</p>
<p>“You can write to-morrow, O. D.”</p>
<p>“I can?” said O. D. “I thought it would be
pretty hard to get a chance to write at the
front.”</p>
<p>“That’s what most of the guys spend their
time doin’ when there ain’t no firin’ or work,”
assured Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Well, good night, old man.”</p>
<p>“<i>Bon swoir</i>, O. D.”</p>
<p>The mention of Mary made Jimmy forget
about sleeping. Since the night that he had
spent in the French house with O. D. he had
been day-dreaming whenever the chance to do
so came. He wondered if Mary was in love
with somebody back in America or in France.
That idea disquieted him a great deal, but
judging from O. D.’s conversations, he felt at
liberty to hope that her heart was still free.</p>
<p>When he was sure that O. D. was sound
asleep Jimmy lit a cigarette and took Mary’s
picture out of his pocket. By drawing hard
on the cigarette he caused a fire glow that
was enough to enable him to catch glimpses
of her face.</p>
<p>“Gosh! She’s a pretty, slender somebody,”
mused the Yank to himself. “Bet she’s as
sweet as she looks. It’ll be great gettin’ letters
from her. If I make this old <i>guerre</i> I’m
sure goin’ to know Mary O. D. But I’m a nut.
What business have I got thinkin’ that she’ll
even look at a bum like me? I’d disgrace her
most likely in public, ’specially at a dinnertable,
as I’d forget and use the old knife. Got
to put the brakes on this cussin’ stuff, too. I
can imagine her if I said ‘damn’ in front of
her. I’d be <i>fineed toot sweet</i>.” Jimmy put
the picture away and puffed on while his
dreams mingled with his blue cigarette
smoke.</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER XV—PINCHING OFF THE ST. MIHIEL SALIENT</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>By noon of the next day Battery C’s guns
had all been securely emplaced. O. D.
wrote three letters in the morning, all of
which centered around Jimmy McGee and the
front. In his letter to Mary he said, in part:</p>
<div class='blockq'>
<p>You’ll love Jimmy, he’s so big and
kind. If he ever got all cleaned and
dressed he’d sure be handsome, but the
boys don’t have time for that kind of life
up here.</p>
<p>Mary, Jimmy never gets any letters,
except from a few boys that work where
he used to. His folks are all dead. I told
him that you would write to him. He is
sending you a German officer’s helmet
that he took from a German at Château-Thierry.
You see, Jimmy has been at
the front for a long time.</p>
<p>I am at the front with him now. But,
somehow, I don’t feel like I thought I
would. It doesn’t seem so terribly different
from a place that we stopped at
about twenty miles from here. Of course
the guns make a lot of noise when they go
off and there’s all kinds of mysterious
lights at night that make you think of
ghosts at work. But the airplanes and
bombs are what scare me most....</p>
</div>
<p>Before supper was served on the afternoon
of September 11th the guns of Jimmy
McGee’s regiment had registered on their
targets and everything was in readiness to
participate in the greatest effort that the
First American Army was destined to make
on the fields of France.</p>
<p>That night there were no certain indications
that the drive would start immediately.
The ordinary precautions were taken. But
they alone did not suggest to the men that
something big was about to happen. Yet,
in the blood of them all, a fever was present
which brought its presentiments.</p>
<p>“O. D., I got a hunch. Nothin’ certain in
this <i>guerre</i>, you know. But I’ve got a feelin’
in my fingers that we’re goin’ to use old
Betsy to-night,” spoke Jimmy.</p>
<p>“Jimmy—Jimmy.” Neil was calling him.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“How do things look to you?” asked Neil,
crawling in the little shelter tent.</p>
<p>“I was just sayin’ to O. D. that I’ve got
a hunch—just like the one before the battle
of Seicheprey—that somethin’ is goin’ to
come off. Mighty damn quiet, though. But
it’s always that way before a real racket.”</p>
<p>“What time have you got, O. D.?” asked
Neil.</p>
<p>“Darn near midnight. Jimmy and I have
been sittin’ around talking a good deal. What
are you doing up?”</p>
<p>“I’m on guard to-night.”</p>
<p>The shrill blast of a pocket whistle interrupted
him and caused the three of them to
jump a little.</p>
<p>“Callin’ to the guns, boys,” whispered
Jimmy. “I knew somethin’ was in the wind.
Get ready, O. D.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to beat it, then,” said Neil, getting
out.</p>
<p>In a few seconds Jimmy and O. D. were
running toward their gun-pit. Soon afterward
the other members of the crew were at
their stations.</p>
<p>Just as the executive officer was giving
out the firing data the world seemed caught
in the vortex of a terrible electrical storm.
Up in front of Battery C’s position a barrage
from the seventy-five’s crashed into life. Big
guns away behind the position began to bay.</p>
<p>Jimmy got orders to fire. The darkness of
night was lost in blinding flashes of yellow
flames that came from the thundering guns.
Shells whined and whistled on their way
toward the German trenches and positions.
O. D. rammed the shells home, wondering if
the world was coming to an end. The roar
of the pieces, the rattle of machine-guns, the
earth that quivered beneath him and the skies
that seemed to be blazing with varicolored
fires assailed his ears, his eyes, and his soul
with a violence that he had never dreamed of.
He looked to Jimmy for confidence. Jimmy
was working his sights and traversing the
piece as if he were listening to a jazz victrola
record. O. D. bit his lips. He knew that one
of his real trials was at hand.</p>
<p>The din of battle became a unison of wild,
barbaric music. Out where the doughboys
were going over, under the barrages, rockets
crawled against the livid heavens. O. D.
thought of dragons and unearthly monsters
as he watched these things.</p>
<p>The scream of a shell, more sinister than
the rest, caused O. D.’s hair to stand up
straight.</p>
<p>“That one’s comin’ in,” bawled out Jimmy.</p>
<p>Another shell whistled in the same fashion.</p>
<p>B—A—N—G!</p>
<p>The sound of an explosion new to the ears
of O. D. throttled the vicinity of his piece. A
human cry made itself heard above the angry
roaring of the guns.</p>
<p>“Somebody got it—poor guy!” shouted
Jimmy. O. D. nodded and kept on placing
the shells on the tray and ramming them in
the smoking breech.</p>
<p>For four hours the battle storm raged incessantly.
During those hours Jimmy’s gun
crew worked away with straining muscles.
There was no mental or spiritual strain attached
to their labor. They were hardened to
the unnatural sounds and sights of modern
fighting. But O. D., new to the things of big
action, face to face with the relentless fury of
war for the first time, had to contend with
both the physical and spiritual conditions
which presented themselves. He was naturally
strong; but four hours of work, under
stress of fighting, made his arms and back
feel as if they were breaking. No man, however
iron of will and nerves, can go through
his first battle without some demoralization
of his mental forces. O. D. was only an ordinary
boy. Naturally he suffered his share
of spiritual anguish in the trying moments of
competition for the control of his soul powers
before the onslaught of terrors that threatened
to smash his nerve and courage.</p>
<p>When orders to cease firing came O. D.
was tired and a bit wan. But he had found
himself. That alone counted with him. A
few moments later, when Jimmy asked him
how he liked it, O. D. found himself answering:</p>
<p>“It kind of got me at first—especially
when that wounded man cried out. But
when I didn’t stop to think, and kept on working,
I didn’t mind it so much.”</p>
<p>“That’s the stuff. Now you’ve heard all
the noise that they can make in this war, so
you’re done with that experience. The rest
of the stuff is only incidental-like,” said Jimmy.
“Course somebody’s got to get killed
or wounded. There wouldn’t be no war if that
didn’t happen. But it won’t be us. It’s
always the other guy. <i>Compree</i>?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>,” answered O. D.</p>
<p>“Get yourself together, boys, we’re pullin’
right out. O. P.’s report that the Germans
are hauling it fast. Hardly any resistance.
<i>Beaucoup</i> prisoners comin’ in. Thousands,
they say. The old doughboys are goin’ like
hell,” shouted Neil, running up to O. D. and
Jimmy.</p>
<p>“That’s the old pep. Come on, O. D., we’re
off to another fight,” and Jimmy started on
the run for the tent.</p>
<p>The first few sharp points of dawn were
piercing the haze of early morning as Jimmy,
O. D., and the rest of the outfit started
across the decaying stretch of land southeast
of wrecked Mouilly. For four long years the
ground that the Yankees trampled underfoot
had been the No Man’s Land between the
German and French lines. There was no real
road, just a winding succession of shell-holes
and gaping craters, bordered on one side by
a water-filled trench that had been the late
target of American guns. On the other side
of the ruined road stretched a bumpy, chaotic
plain, out of which the snags of shell-smashed
trees lifted jagged points and shattered limbs.
Rusty barbed wire was strung in baffling
tangles from every charred stump and smoking
post. Demolished guns, rifles, bayonets,
and sundry articles of equipment were littered
over the grim terrain. Gray desolation,
destruction, and barrenness abounded.</p>
<p>“This is what they call the <i>Grande
Tranchée</i>, O. D. Never seen anything like
this, even in the movin’ pictures, did you?”
questioned Jimmy.</p>
<p>O. D.’s eyes were fastened on a gruesome
heap of headless men whose bodies were torn,
twisted, and partly covered by debris. He
shuddered before answering.</p>
<p>“No, Jimmy. Look down there,” pointing
to the dead.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, Boches,” responded Jimmy, casually.
“Sure tore up this place some. Our old
Betsy was landin’ ’em down here. Ain’t
nothin’ over three feet high ’round here.”</p>
<p>A long column of German prisoners filed
by under guard of American doughboys.</p>
<p>“What outfit, buddy?” asked Jimmy of a
guard.</p>
<p>“First Division,” answered the man.</p>
<p>“Seen much of the Twenty-sixth doughboys?”
questioned Jimmy.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>, they beat us into Vigunelles. Those
guys sure bagged some Boches,” and the
guard picked up a faster step with his prisoners.</p>
<p>The attack was still in force and shells were
plowing up the broken ground in every direction
when the battery arrived opposite a German
cemetery. Orders were received at that
point for the regiment to go into position behind
the hills of St. Rémy. The tired and
worn columns entered the woods by a road
that had been used by the Germans only the
day before.</p>
<p>“The Boches must have thought that they
was here to stay, by the looks of this joint,”
said Jimmy, pointing to the graveyard with
its high stone fence and tall tombstones.
“The Boches got in here four years ago and
never moved till last night. That accounts
for all this stuff. Guess they had regular
funerals and church services for the guys
that got knocked off. Just goes to show how
they was fightin’ the <i>guerre</i> up here. Livin’
the life of Riley and didn’t know it.”</p>
<p>He and O. D. climbed over the fence and
inspected some of the tombstones. They
came to an exceptionally big one.</p>
<p>“Guess this gink must have been a general.
Can’t read Boche, but most likely all
the stuff reads, ‘He died for God and Country.’
See that ‘Gott’ business on ’em all.
Everybody pulls the same line when a guy
gets killed. Funny thing, but there ain’t many
shell-holes in cemeteries. Now and then you
see one all turned upside down from shell-fire.
But most of ’em that I’ve seen get by
somehow. Maybe the shells get superstitious.”</p>
<p>“There is where one shell hit.” O. D.
showed Jimmy a grave that had been dug
out by a shell.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>. Even the dead don’t get no rest in
this <i>guerre</i>,” declared Jimmy.</p>
<p>The whine of an incoming shell caused them
both to fall flat on their bellies. An explosion
followed. Dirt and stones covered them
from head to foot.</p>
<p>“Beat it <i>toot sweet</i>. This joint ain’t no
place for a live man, O. D.,” and Jimmy
started for the wall at double-time. They
caught up with the battery a few minutes
before the order to halt came.</p>
<p>“We’re goin’ to use an old German position
here,” said Neil, coming up to Jimmy.
“You never saw such stuff in your life. The
Boches have got dug-outs fifty feet deep.
Regular places, beds, sofas, everything.
You’d think they had bought the place for a
resort.</p>
<p>“That’s nothin’,” broke in Pop Rigney.
“Down at the foot of the hill in Hattonville
they’ve got regular theaters built up. Boche
<i>cafés</i>. They say Boche women used to live
here with the officers. Joyce found some silk
stockings and a woman’s hat in one dug-out.”</p>
<p>Jimmy and O. D. went on an exploration
tour immediately. They found that the dug-outs
were all built of cement and stone and
must have necessitated months in construction.
A piano, all smashed up, was found in
one. There were various kinds of mysterious
cords and wires in most of the <i>abris</i>. O. D.
said that he thought they must be attached
to bells, but Jimmy warned him that the
Boches had most likely left them tied to some
kind of death-dealing engine and to keep his
hands off. That same day a member of the
outfit tampered with a string and had his
left hand mangled by a hand grenade which
fell to the stone floor as a result and exploded
on contact.</p>
<p>The Germans had fled so precipitately
from their positions that they even left all
the guns behind them. The men found souvenirs
galore, but threw most of them away,
as they had no means of carting around extra
stuff.</p>
<p>“I’m off the souvenir stuff. I’ll be good
enough souvenir if I get myself back,” said
Jimmy as he discarded some German belts
that he had picked up.</p>
<p>“Guess we’ll get back and <i>monjay</i>. ’Ain’t
had any breakfast yet, you know,” suggested
Neil.</p>
<p>In the mess-line the talk was running fast.
Samson and Johnson, who had been up in
the O. P.’s with the doughboys and had just
returned to the outfit, told about the capture
of St. Mihiel and the speed with which the
Boches were evacuating the salient.</p>
<p>“We’re in a hell of a fix, though,” said
Samson. “Can’t move another inch forward.
There’s a plain twenty kilometers deep in
front of us. The Boches have got high
ground behind it and we couldn’t go across
it without losing the whole division. Guess
we’ll have to stand pat awhile. Ain’t that
hell?”</p>
<p>His words panned out true. Before the
guns of the Yankee division lay a great deep
plain. To send men out into that plain meant
to expose them to certain death with no possibility
of a military advantage being obtained
by so doing. Consequently, with the
exception of a sacrifice attack planned against
the enemy to divert his attention from the
major operations being launched in the Argonne
forest, the division remained in its victorious
tracks for nearly six weeks. The sacrifice
attack succeeded, but it cost the division
almost the entire One Hundred and Second
Infantry Regiment.</p>
<p>During this time O. D. drank to the dregs
of the front. He became able to distinguish
the difference between the whine of an ordinary shell
and the whistle of a gas shell.
Whizz-bangs got to be a part of his vocabulary,
and he knew enough to duck <i>toot sweet</i>
when he heard one coming. The mud stuck
to him as Neil told him it would. He became
friendly with cooties.</p>
<p>“Damn it all, Jimmy,” said O. D. five weeks
after the St. Mihiel salient had been nipped
off by the pinchers of the First American
Army, “if they’d only lay off that ‘canned
willy’ once in a while this <i>guerre</i> wouldn’t be
half bad. Say, I lost my gas-mask two days
ago, wonder if Joyce has got any in yet. The
Boches are puttin’ gas over right along now.”</p>
<p>“Hope the hell we get up to a regular
front again soon,” replied Jimmy, offering
O. D. a cigarette. “Since Austria blew up
we ought to get behind the Boches and push
’em right in the Rhine.”</p>

<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER XVI—BEYOND VERDUN</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>“Is this place hot enough to suit you, Jimmy?”
asked O. D. as he and Jimmy
huddled in a water-filled shell-hole while a
drove of barrack bags went skimming over
their heads.</p>
<p>“I’ll say, <i>oui</i>,” replied Jimmy. “Wish for
a thing and you’ll sure get it. Remember
my wishing that they’d send us to a real
front. There ain’t no camouflage to this
joint. Listen to that damn machine-gun
music, will you?”</p>
<p>From the depths of the Haumont Bois issued
the frenzied snapping and barking of
machine-guns that contrasted strangely with
the unending thunder-roll of the heavy guns.</p>
<p>Before Jimmy and his pal was the pivot
upon which the German defenses in the
Argonne depended. Upon that cemented
pivot was hinged the hopes of the German
High Command. If the pivot was forced
the entire line of defenses that swung
back and forth like a red, intangible thing
in the depth of the Argonne woods
would be swept away by the intrepid
American troops. The Prussian militarists
had rushed some of their finest divisions in
front of Verdun to stay the advance of American
soldiers who had been ordered to unhinge
the pivotal defense at all costs.</p>
<p>It mattered not that companies and battalions
were cut to pieces and mowed down
by the hidden machine-gun fire of the Germans
who held the high ground and were
securely intrenched. The order was to force
the pivot. Jimmy’s division had been ordered
to unhinge it.</p>
<p>For three weeks he and his comrades had
advanced yard by yard, each yard calling
for the sacrifice of many brave men. After
the third day in the lines beyond Verdun
Jimmy had looked for his friend Neil, to
learn that an ugly shell wound had sent him
to the hospital. An entire new gun crew was
manning the first piece, as every man had
been killed or wounded when a German two-hundred-and-twenty
made a direct hit on the
howitzer. The Boches had been using gas
with deadly effect. Ten men that he knew
very well had been caught by the poisonous
fumes and were evacuated to a hospital.
Death had come pretty close to both Jimmy
and O. D., but by some law of destiny they
had come through unscratched.</p>
<p>“We might try to get back now, O. D.”
Jimmy raised himself cautiously and scanned
their surroundings.</p>
<p>A shell whistled, almost in his ear. He
ducked down again.</p>
<p>“That drink of water may cost us a lot before
we get back. Gee! but I was thirsty. No
water in three days. It’ll be three more
before we can pull this stunt again. Think
them damn Heinies have got us under observation.
Stuff’s comin’ mighty close.
They’re breakin’ right over by that hill.” He
pointed to a hill not a hundred yards away.
It was perforated by shell hits and blue smoke
was rising from a dozen places where shells
had lately exploded.</p>
<p>“Dick said we were goin’ to fire again,
<i>toot sweet</i>, so we’ll have to make a dive for
it. You follow me, O. D.”</p>
<p>Jimmy squirmed out of the slimy hole and
crawled away in the direction of his position.
O. D. followed behind at about ten yards’
interval. The condition of O. D.’s clothing
made him look like a tramp. His wrap puttees
were mud-soaked and ripped in many
places. His breeches were as dirty as Jimmy’s
had ever been. He had the front written
all over him. The <i>guerre</i> had stamped
its trade-mark upon O. D.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes of snakelike progress
Jimmy and O. D. reached the position. There
wasn’t a soul to be seen. Everybody and
everything lived below the surface in those
terrible days and nights beyond Verdun.</p>
<p>“Let’s get down to the old hole and lie
quiet till it’s time to fire,” and Jimmy crawled
down to what he and O. D. called “the hole.”</p>
<p>It was their home. The boys had stretched
their canvas shelter-halves over the top of a
crater made by a giant shell. Underneath
this protection was their stock and store of
worldly possessions, which consisted of an odd
sock, a suit of dirty underclothes, and a little
box that held a few personal trinkets. Raincoats,
and what little extra underclothes they
once owned, had been lost in the advance
from Verdun.</p>
<p>Jimmy got to “the hole” first.</p>
<p>“Great Lord, O. D.! Here’s some mail.
Ration cart just brought it up from the
<i>échelon</i>. Guess it’s all for you. No here’s
three for me,” he cried, excitedly.</p>
<p>Mail it was. The first that they had seen
in nearly a month. Jimmy had three letters
from Mary and in one was two pictures.</p>
<p>“To hell with this <i>guerre</i>!” shouted Jimmy,
jumping up.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Jimmy? Get good
news from some of the boys?” asked O. D.</p>
<p>“Boys hell!” answered Jimmy. “They’re
from Mary—” then he stopped short and felt
kind of foolish.</p>
<p>“Oh!” exclaimed O. D. “I knew Mary
would write if I told her to. I’ve got some
from her and mother.”</p>
<p>The two boys read their letters on in
silence. The more that Jimmy read of Mary’s
letters the more he was willing to believe the
rumors that had been coming in by radio that
the Germans might sign an armistice. In fact,
you could have told Jimmy almost anything
at that moment and he would have believed
it. He studied Mary’s new pictures with the
one that he had taken from O. D. O. D.
caught him in the act.</p>
<p>“Mary gave me one of those seashore pictures
before I left, but I lost it some place
lately,” said O. D., looking at the two new
pictures.</p>
<p>“Yes, I guess you did, O. D. I swiped it
from you. Don’t mind, do you, old man? I
wanted a picture of Mary.”</p>
<p>“Did you take that one, Jimmy?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>.”</p>
<p>“Anything you do, old boy, is O. K. with
me. You know that, Jimmy, don’t you?”
asked the brother of Mary.</p>
<p>“Bet I do, O. D. Funny how guys get to
be pals up here, ain’t it! Back in the States
you and me would have passed each other up,
most likely. Out here it’s mighty darn different.
Makes a fellow get down under the
skin of things. I feel like I’ve known you
all my life, O. D.”</p>
<p>“So do I, Jimmy. I never knew any fellow
as good as I’ve come to know you.”</p>
<p>“Well, when men get close to dyin’ with
each other, when they’ve starved side by side
and damn near froze to death under the same
pieces of cheesecloth, it ain’t any wonder
that they find out who and what each other
is. Do you know, it’s gettin’ colder every
night? We’ve got to rustle up some more
coverin’ soon or we’ll pass out one of these
nights. It’s that cold mud underneath us that
puts ice in the bones. Look here, O. D., don’t
you wake up in the night no more and listen
to me talk in my sleep ’bout cold and put your
coat over me. Keep it on your side. I’m
more used to this stuff than you,” commanded
Jimmy.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t cold, Jimmy, honest. Think I’ll
turn over and <i>cushay</i> a while. We ’ain’t slept
in forty-eight hours now. There won’t be anything
to <i>monjay</i> tonight; stuff got in too late
for supper. Goin’ to give us some coffee and
stuff ’round nine o’clock.”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll both crawl in and knock out
some sleep,” said Jimmy, and they got under
their thin dirt-spattered blankets and fell into
sound slumber with no effort.</p>
<p>Three hours later Jimmy and O. D. were
throttled out of their sleep by the banging
of incoming shells and the quaking of earth
that shivered and shook as the shells ripped
great smoking holes in its sides.</p>
<p>Between the bangs and the crashes they
caught the piping of the whistle that called
them to the pits. Twenty seconds later Sergeant
Dick Dennis, chief of Jimmy’s gun section,
sang out to the executive officer, “Third
section in order, sir.”</p>
<p>“Battery—On basic deflection—Right, One—Three—Zero—F.
A. shell—I. A. L. fuse—Charge
double zero—Site zero—One hundred
rounds—At my command—Elevation five, six
three,” shouted the executive officer.</p>
<p>There was grim silence in the gun-pits. A
shell came tearing over and hit fifty yards
from the first piece. Fragments and stones
pattered down through the trees.</p>
<p>“F—I—R—E!” was the command.</p>
<p>Four flashes illuminated the night shadows
and four guns loosened their brass tongues
of thunder. The ground rocked. The air
quivered. The pieces bayed and roared on
like mad, fire-spitting animals. Joining their
voices in the savage symphony of death
that filled the woods they crowded that particular
part of the world with an infernal
clamor.</p>
<p>Down in the cozy mire of their gun-pit
Jimmy McGee and his gang worked hands
over fists to keep Betsy roaring. Almost ten
months on the line had made them indifferent
to enemy fire, especially if they were fighting
back, so they labored on while the Hun missiles
came tearing overhead, spilling their
contents of death dangerously near.</p>
<p>O. D., working directly behind Jimmy, marveled
at his pal’s coolness in adjusting sights
and elevations, unconscious of the fact that
he was almost as cool in his own work as
Jimmy.</p>
<p>An explosion more terrific than any previous
one shook the entire vicinity of the battery
position. After the crash of bursting
steel and iron had ended agonized cries were
torn from the throats of suffering men.
Piteous pleadings for aid filled the flame-shot
night. Above the groans that were racked
by pain a voice called out, “First piece out
of order, sir.” A fit of coughing followed
the report.</p>
<p>Spare men and the two Sanitary Corps men
rushed to the pit of the first section where
the shell had landed and demolished the
gun while tearing the crew into lifeless or
quivering wrecks of humans. Everything
that could be done for the men was accomplished
heedless of the incoming shells.
Every moment brought an increasing number
of shells into the immediate vicinity of the
battery position. Trees were smashed and
chewed to bits. Earth was thrown high into
the air. Tree branches mingled with the shell
splinters that rained down.</p>
<p>“Second section out of order, sir,” shouted
the chief of that section. His gunner had
reported that the bore would not stand another
shot. The piece had been recommended
for the mobile repair shop two weeks before.</p>
<p>“Second section, abandon your piece. Take
cover,” ordered the executive officer, crowding
data for the third and fourth piece on
top of that command.</p>
<p>Jimmy McGee’s crew was still putting them
over when fragments from a shell that had
ruined the fourth section knocked his Nos.
4 and 6 down. Short-handed he kept the
hot one-hundred-and-fifty-five howitzer going.
O. D. was still hanging on the rammer and
pushing the big shells in the breech.</p>
<p>Captain Henderson rushed into the pit.</p>
<p>“You men take shelter. Your gun’s the
only one left in action.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t make us quit, Pop. Pardon,
sir. Shoot the dope along. We’ll stick, won’t
we, O. D.?”</p>
<p>“Bet we will, Jimmy!” shot back O. D.,
grimly, as he helped his No. 5 get the shell
on the tray.</p>
<p>The answer had barely escaped his lips
when a shell made a direct hit on a tree behind
the pit. O. D. fell to the ground. Jimmy
McGee sank down with a stifled groan.
The two boys left in the pit toppled like young
trees from the blow of a mighty ax.</p>
<p>The captain, who was untouched, raised
Jimmy and got his knee under his head.</p>
<p>“Get Bacon or March, the first-aid men,
quick!” commanded the captain to a man who
was stumbling over the debris in the pit.</p>
<p>“Both of ’em are down, sir; got hit. The
boys are havin’ a hell of a time with the
wounded.” The man stooped to pick up Dick
Dennis, who had been killed outright.</p>
<p>“My God!” groaned Henderson, tearing
away Jimmy’s blouse to get at his wounded
arm.</p>
<p>“Cap—cap,” called Jim, feebly. Henderson
bent over him. “I’ve only got a splinter—only
stunned. Get to O. D. first.” Jimmy
tried to get loose and go to O. D., who lay
quiet in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>“Johnson—Johnson, try to bind O. D.’s
wound,” ordered the C. O., turning to a man
who sat all huddled up amid the horror and
torture, puffing wildly at a cigarette like some
grotesque being.</p>
<p>“Can’t touch him,” answered Johnson,
blowing a mouthful of smoke after the jerky
words. “God have mercy on me,” he kept repeating.
The fellow’s nerve was gone. Henderson
had seen a few like him before. He
let him alone.</p>
<p>Jimmy crawled to O. D.</p>
<p>“O. D.—O. D.! Talk to me! God! Look
at his back; it’s all busted up. O. D., I’m
Jimmy. Answer me, boy,” implored his pal.</p>
<p>Henderson came with a mess-cup full of
water and some bandages.</p>
<p>The water brought O. D. to a state of semi-consciousness.
Jimmy saw his eyes flutter
open about half-way and he started talking
again.</p>
<p>“We’re fixin’ you, boy—hang on. The
Boches never was made to get you and me.
We got to go back to Mary, O. D.”</p>
<p>“Jimmy—Jimmy—” The name was called
so faintly that Jimmy could hardly hear it.
He bent his ear close to O. D.’s blue lips.</p>
<p>“I’m listenin’, pal. What is it?”</p>
<p>“You go back—back—back—to Mary
for—” The words trembled and stopped short.</p>
<p>“For you, O. D.?” supplied Jimmy.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>,” gasped the dying boy.</p>
<p>“But you’ll go, too, O. D. Hell, you can’t
die now.”</p>
<p>“Yes—die—later—see you—somewhere—
Good-by, Jim—” Death cut the words short.</p>
<p>A great lump rose in Jimmy McGee’s
throat. Something warm and salty burned his
eyes. He pressed his good hand against the
torn back of his pal and tried to staunch the
incessant red flow with his fingers. Captain
Henderson removed him tenderly from the
body of his pal a few moments later and led
Jimmy, dry-eyed and white-faced, over to the
dressing-station.</p>
<p>“Just the way of it, cap. The best guys
gets it. Poor O. D.!” muttered Jimmy as
they bound up his splintered arm.</p>
<p>They buried O. D. in a shell-hole and wrapped
his body in the blankets and shelter-halves
that he and Jimmy had slept between.
Jimmy looked at the sad mound of earth and
then let them take him away to the ambulance
that was to bring him and two others
down to the <i>échelon</i> infirmary. His wound
was not deemed serious enough for hospital
treatment.</p>

<div class='c'>
<h2 class='mt2em mb1em fs1r2em chapter'>CHAPTER XVII—“FINEE! LA GUERRE FINEE!”</h2>
</div>
<p class='ti0'>In the somber shadow of gaunt, historic Verdun
the eleventh day of the eleventh month
of 1918 crawled slowly toward its epoch-making
eleventh hour. The progress of each
advancing minute was accompanied by a
bombardment that started in a rumbling basso-profundo
of fourteen-inch naval guns and
reached its crescendo of barbaric medley in a
crackling cataract of machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>“You can’t tell me that this <i>guerre</i> is goin’
to <i>finee toot sweet</i>,” asserted Jimmy McGee
to an infirmary orderly. “Listen to that
hell-bent-for-election noise.” He paused to
allow himself and the orderly to appreciate
the significance of his assertion.</p>
<p>Both had grown accustomed to the thunder
of barrages and the din of battles, but their
ears were not listening to any ordinary bombardment.
Their pals in arms were putting
over the heaviest artillery fusillade that had
ever made the base of Verdun’s brave citadel
tremble. The noise was magnificent and awe-inspiring.
The men held their tongues awhile.
Then Jimmy spoke.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s possible, but I doubt it. How
the hell can they stop a thing like this <i>guerre</i>
so quick?”</p>
<p>“Damn if I know. Sounds like bull to me,
but the radio order says that we stop fightin’
at eleven o’clock. That’s all I know,” answered
the orderly.</p>
<p>“I’m going to breeze ’round a bit. If it’s
straight dope I’ll blow up to the position.
Want to get a picture of O. D.’s grave.
Camouflage me if any of them guys get wonderin’
where I am. The old wing’s gettin’
<i>très-bon</i> now, anyhow. They might just as
well let me go back to the battery,” and
Jimmy took his bandaged left arm out of its
sling just to prove his words.</p>
<p>“Go on, I’ll cover you up,” said the orderly.</p>
<p>Jimmy wandered through the different barracks
of the regimental <i>échelon</i> and finally
landed at Headquarters Office.</p>
<p>“What’s the dope, Barney?” asked Jimmy
of a bespectacled sergeant who sat humped
over a desk full of morning reports.</p>
<p>“The <i>guerre</i> is <i>finee</i> at eleven o’clock,” was
the answer in slow, methodic tones.</p>
<div class='figcenter id05'>
  <img id='i005' src='images/illus-200.jpg' style='width:100%;' alt='' />
  <div class='caption fs0r8em'>
    “I WANT TO GET A PICTURE OF O. D.’s GRAVE”
  </div>
</div>
<p>“Guess it’s straight enough if Barney believes
it,” muttered Jimmy, closing the door.</p>
<p>He found Joyce, borrowed a pocket camera
from him, and started for the front. Jimmy
evaded Verdun and picked the straight road
from Thierville to Bras. From Bras he intended
following the muddy trail that led
directly to the present position of his outfit.</p>
<p>A continuous stream of nondescript traffic
flowed past him going in the direction of the
<i>échelons</i>. Captured Boche wagons, ammunition
limbers, ration-trucks, caissons, staff
cars, and ambulances were some of the
vehicles that passed Jimmy as he plodded
along. Their presence on the road at ten-thirty
in the morning was a significant thing
in itself. He knew that such heavy traffic
was forbidden on roads that were under
enemy fire during the hours of daylight. But
the rattle and clatter of the motley traffic
could not drown out the fury of the American
bombardment.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s <i>finee</i>, old man,” shouted a man
in fatigue clothes riding a balky mule.</p>
<p>“<i>Oui</i>,” responded Jimmy, unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>At Bras Jimmy stopped at one of the ambulance
stations to watch them load on some
boys who had just been wounded.</p>
<p>“Where the hell are you bound? The
<i>guerre’s finee</i>.”</p>
<p>Jimmy looked at the speaker. He was Mike
Merrowitz, of his own outfit.</p>
<p>“Goin’ up to the battery. What the hell
did you do to your arm, Mike?”</p>
<p>“Nothin’ much. Was mendin’ a broken
wire early this mornin’ and a piece of shell
got me there. Doc said they might have to
cut it off at the elbow. But I don’t believe
it’s that bad. Remember my tellin’ you that
I’d go through this <i>guerre</i> and get walloped
on the last day? Well, the damn thing is
<i>finee</i>, anyhow. Take care, Jimmy,” he admonished,
looking at his bandaged arm.</p>
<p>Jimmy McGee could only nod his answer.
The idea that a man could go through the
war as long as Mike had and then get hit
during the last minute of play was beyond
him. He began wondering if it was all a mistake
about the <i>guerre</i> being finished. The
banging of the guns certainly didn’t help
him to renew his faith in all the statements
that he had heard to the effect that fighting
would end at eleven o’clock.</p>
<p>It was exactly ten-forty-five when he started
out on the second lap of his trip.</p>
<p>“Fifteen minutes to make good in,” muttered
Jimmy to himself.</p>
<p>Along the sides of the slimy trail strange
things were happening. Men began to appear
on the surface. Horses and mules
browsed around, hunting for a green patch
of grass.</p>
<p>“What time have you got, buddy?” asked
Jimmy of a man who was stripped to the
waist and washing in an honest attempt to
remove some of the dirt that had accumulated
on his body since the wash of two months
ago.</p>
<p>The man stopped and picked up his wrist
watch. “Five minutes before knocking-off
time, Jack,” was the casual reply.</p>
<p>“Five minutes,” repeated Jimmy McGee,
doubtfully. “Say, do you think it’ll <i>finee</i> at
eleven?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,” was the confident reply. “It
started in ten minutes; why the hell can’t it
end in a few minutes?”</p>
<p>“Guess it can, but it seems funny as hell
to talk ’bout the <i>guerre</i> endin’. Why, there’s
been times lately when I thought the damn
thing would never <i>finee</i>,” stated Jimmy, very
solemnly.</p>
<p>“It will be strange to have it all finished.
But I can get along without it. Say, I wonder
when the hell we’ll go home, Jack?”</p>
<p>“Great God! I’d never thought of that.
If this <i>guerre finees</i> to-day we ought to get a
crack at the first boats. Been over here long
enough. Can you imagine gettin’ back to the
old life, wearin’ garters and stuff like that?”</p>
<p>“Too much for me, Jack,” admitted the
man as he scrubbed away.</p>
<p>The bombardment seemed just in the act
of flinging all of its violence into their ears
when the roar of cannon and the shrieking of
shells toned down to a puny whisper. A few
seconds of scattered “booms” passed. Then
a silence unknown to that part of the world
settled over the vicinity of Verdun.</p>
<p>The guns of war had been hushed as if by
the magic command of some invisible master
voice.</p>
<p>Jimmy and the man looked at each other,
stunned into dumbness by the miracle of
silence. Five minutes passed in strange
quietude.</p>
<p>“Guess I’ll blow up to the guns and see
how the boys are takin’ this stuff,” said
Jimmy, slowly.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s <i>finee</i>, sure as hell,” declared
the man. He was reading his shirt and
snapping his catches between thumb-nails.</p>
<p>“So long, bud; I’ll meet you in Boston,”
was Jimmy’s parting shot.</p>
<p>“In Boston, eh?” replied the man as if a
new and pleasing idea had occurred to him.
“<i>Oui</i>—in Boston.”</p>
<p>The pockmarked hills that sloped down to
meet the trail and mingle muddy rivulets with
the slimy water that stagnated in its shell-holes
took on a new lease of life as Jimmy
surveyed them. Dark rings of smoke curled
upward. The forms of men and animals began
to appear, slowly at first, as if the bowels
of the earth were giving up their recent inhabitants
with great reluctance. Gradually
whole processions of men moved against the
horizons made by the dip and rise of Verdun’s
storied hills. Mules and horses scampered
at liberty and joined their braying
and neighing with the sounds of human life
that were heard in the great silence that obtained.</p>
<p>Turning an abrupt curve Jimmy McGee was
almost upon his battery. Even Jimmy, who
had grown to believe that he had seen every
sight that the front could offer, admitted that
the scene before him was unusual.</p>
<p>Humans and creatures who had been
spending most of the last two months below
the surface were breathing God’s free air
once more without risking their lives by so
doing. Men in undershirts, some without any,
most all of them bareheaded, were stretching,
washing, shaving, talking, and doing many
other simple and ordinary things as if they
were all undergoing a novel experience.
There was not a clean-faced man in the
crowd.</p>
<p>The four guns that had been participating
in the final barrage of the war stood in their
crude emplacements like stage-settings in a
scene that had been deserted by all of the
actors. They looked forlorn and lonely in
their abandonment.</p>
<p>Equipment, most of it soiled, stained, and
rusty, was piled in little heaps. A batch of
rations had been uncovered and lay exposed
to the possibility of unlawful seizure, as
guards were a nonentity. Smoke issued from
a field range that was in operation. The
rattle of mess-kits announced the fact that
the small line of men who had formed for
mess were hungry.</p>
<p>Jimmy made for a group of men who were
standing around a bucket of water, waiting
their turn to wash.</p>
<p>“Hello, Sammy; how’s the boy?” asked
McGee of a short, stocky lad in the waiting
line of toilet-makers.</p>
<p>“<i>Bon</i>, Jimmy,” responded Sampson.
“What do you think of this guerre being
<i>fineed</i>?”</p>
<p>“Gosh! I can hardly believe it.”</p>
<p>“I keep thinking that it’s liable to start
up any old time,” admitted Sammy.</p>
<p>“Are you goin’ down to the <i>échelon</i>, Sammy?”</p>
<p>“<i>Oui, toot sweet</i>. Wait till I get a ton
of this dirt off and I’ll hike along with you.”</p>
<p>“All right, I’m goin’ to look ’round just a
bit. Will see you at the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“<i>Trey-beans</i>.”</p>
<p>Jimmy toured the position and inspected
his Betsy.</p>
<p>“Well, old girl, you’re <i>finee</i> now,” he said,
patting the barrel of his faithful piece affectionately.</p>
<p>He talked with all the boys he met. The
one big question that they put to him was,
“Know when we go home, Jimmy?” But
that was a query beyond his power to answer.
A few hinted that the division might be sent
into Germany as a part of the Army of Occupation.
These suggestions were routed by
indignant denial of such a possibility.</p>
<p>“They’ll never send this outfit to Germany.
We’re slated for home. Let them guys
that just got over here take a crack at that
stuff,” snapped Pop Rigney.</p>
<p>Later, after they had mess, Jimmy and
Sammy started cross-country for Thierville
so that they might pass O. D.’s grave and
make a picture of it.</p>
<p>Jimmy found the mound of earth that covered
the mortal remains of his pal, and after
arranging the helmet on the crude little
cross he photographed the grave and walked
away with the remark, “O. D. was sure one
white man, Sammy.”</p>
<p>They continued in silence until the outskirts
of Verdun were reached.</p>
<p>“Gee! there’s something goin’ on in town,”
declared Sammy.</p>
<p>The sound of pealing bells and stirring
music reached their ears. They quickened
their step. Cheering and shouts sounded
above the music.</p>
<p>A bearded poilu came tearing out of a
ruined house, waving a bottle over his head.</p>
<div class='figcenter id06'>
  <img id='i006' src='images/illus-208.jpg' style='width:100%;' alt='' />
  <div class='caption fs0r8em'>
    “A BEARDED POILU CAME TEARING OUT OF A RUINED HOUSE, WAVING A BOTTLE OVER HIS HEAD”
  </div>
</div>
<p>“<i>Finee! La guerre finee!</i>” he shouted, and
offered them the bottle. They drank and
shouted back:</p>
<p>“<i>Oui. Finee.</i> Hurrah!”</p>
<p>The grizzled poilu and the two Americans
sallied down the narrow street to locate
the music. Progress became difficult after the
trio reached one of the main streets. Soldiers—for
there were very few civilians residing
in the battered remnants of Verdun—piled out
of every doorway and alley, most of them
singing and shouting. Finally, after stopping
to drink the success of the armistice with at
least ten different parties of poilus and Yanks,
Jimmy, Sammy, and their new friend found
themselves in the square where a parade was
forming.</p>
<p>A hastily organized band crashed out the
stirring music of “Quand Madelon.” The
mob cheered itself into action and started off
behind the band. Flags, mostly American,
waved above the surging crowds. Another
band, half American and half French, swung
into the square playing the “Marseillaise.”
Then “The Star-Spangled Banner” brought
a thunderous volley of applause.</p>
<p>“<i>La guerre c’est finie</i>,” was the predominating
cry. “<i>Vivent les Américains!</i>” was
the second in strength.</p>
<p>Most of the demonstrations came from the
throats of the French whose natural dramatic
and emotional temperament responded to the
occasion more quickly than did the less demonstrative
make-ups of the Yankee soldiers.
But it was only natural that the French
should have indulged in greater feelings and
demonstrations than their brothers in arms,
the Americans, for they had borne the yoke
of war years longer. It was wonderful to
see the worn lines on veteran poilu faces as
their sternness relaxed in smiles and laughs.</p>
<p>Jimmy and Sammy found themselves drinking
wine and other liquors with many strange
men. The password to good-fellowship was
“<i>Finee, la guerre finee</i>,” and when the liquor
began to assert itself in the blood of the men
who acclaimed the Allied triumph on the
streets of Verdun good-fellowship reached its
zenith.</p>
<p>That night the men of Jimmy’s section were
gathered around a cheery-looking beer keg in
a comfortable barrack at Thierville hashing
over the <i>guerre</i> and its swift dramatic dénouement.
The flight of the Kaiser and the
downfall of his military empire had dwindled
into a meaningless fact before the expanding
idea of an early departure for home.</p>
<p>“Home! Great Lord, it ain’t possible!”
ejaculated one man as he looked wistfully into
the blazing fire that roared up a great open
fireplace. A bit of silence followed on the
heels of his remark. Then Limy Mills and
Vine started singing the chorus of “There’s a
Long, Long Trail Awinding.” Twenty throats,
unsteady from an emotion that was
new and yet old, joined in the singing.</p>
<p>Jimmy McGee, sitting in a far corner of the
room, looked up from the letter that he was
writing to Mary O. D. and listened while a
strange yearning for something that the song
suggested mastered his feelings.</p>
<p>Four days later Jimmy McGee’s outfit
rolled down the “Sacred Road” of France.
No officer or enlisted man knew its destination.
All that any man could be certain of
was that he was headed for the rear.</p>
<p>Jimmy, lacking a roll and stripped of sundry
equipments that he had carried over the
same road three months before, followed behind
his Betsy.</p>
<p>“What outfit, buddy?” asked an engineer
who leaned on his shovel to watch the decrepit
parade pass.</p>
<p>“Twenty-sixth division,” answered Jimmy.</p>
<p>“You guys are goin’ home <i>toot sweet</i>, ain’t
you?” questioned the engineer.</p>
<p>“So they tell us, buddy,” responded the
Yankee veteran as a man does who speaks
from another world. His thoughts were four
thousand miles away, they stretched across
the ocean and reached a certain, slender
somebody who answered the name of Mary
O. D. in the thoughts of Jimmy McGee.</p>
<p>“Gee! It sure will be tough tryin’ to tell
her and her mother ’bout O. D. I wonder
what Mary’ll think of me,” and Jimmy McGee
trudged along to accept the future, even as
he had accepted the <i>guerre</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
